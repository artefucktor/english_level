3
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:16,947
Thanks so much for
coming on the show today.

4
00:00:16,982 --> 00:00:17,948
Well, my pleasure.

5
00:00:17,983 --> 00:00:19,260
Thanks for having me.

6
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:20,951
And I can't believe
the success you've had.

7
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:23,264
Your book and still
riding number one?

8
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:24,610
Number one, New York Times.

9
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:27,475
Yeah, so I'm very lucky
and I'm very grateful.

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,479
And I know you can't say too
much about what's coming up,

11
00:00:31,514 --> 00:00:33,550
but it's my understanding
you're working

12
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:37,451
on a book about mythology
in the Americas?

13
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:38,624
Yeah, you're right.

14
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:40,350
I can't really tell
you too much about it.

15
00:00:40,385 --> 00:00:42,214
But what I can say is
that it does squarely

16
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:46,356
focus on the mythos and
mythology surrounding

17
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:48,324
fear and the concept of fear.

18
00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:51,327
When can your fans
expect..

19
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:54,744
I'm still really deep into
the research into the book.

20
00:00:54,778 --> 00:00:59,059
I to Northern
California to a very particular

21
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:01,509
area that permeates fear.

22
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:05,686
Fear, just as an emotion is
a manifestation of something

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,861
that we always perceive
as just kind of a concept.

24
00:01:08,896 --> 00:01:09,690
It's not a concept.

25
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:11,036
Fear is very real.

26
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,451
Well, sounds like
The New York Times

27
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:14,729
better make room for
another bestseller.

28
00:01:14,764 --> 00:01:15,627
I hope so.

29
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:17,111
Your lips to God's ears.

30
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:20,321
Diving this deeply into
fear, as you described it--

31
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:21,150
Yeah.

32
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:23,773
-does it strike fear in you?

33
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:24,774
No.

34
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,674
So we've
been covering this story

35
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,953
for quite a while, but it
seems like today's news might

36
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:19,820
be the final chapter in one of
the most bizarre stories we've

37
00:03:19,854 --> 00:03:23,272
had, the story of Angel Wilson.

38
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:26,344
If you remember, Angel is
the missing 26-year-old

39
00:03:26,378 --> 00:03:30,762
from 2015 who was
camping in the Tahoe area

40
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:32,212
and never returned home.

41
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,074
Investigators--

42
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:34,697
Babes, turn it off.

43
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:35,456
Hold on, listen.

44
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:37,769
Once they found

45
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:39,771
that two of the friends
that had accompanied her

46
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:42,670
were discovered deceased
from apparent suicide.

47
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:43,844
Turn it off.

48
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:45,190
And
today, news has broke

49
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,123
that her remains might have--

50
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:49,643
Said
that he's a Gemini.

51
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:52,439
Said that he liked the
one to see her in that.

52
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:55,269
Turned around and
changed his mind.

53
00:03:55,304 --> 00:03:58,479
Thank you, babe, for
getting me out of the house.

54
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:05,935
We sure chose the best
time to get away, right?

55
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:09,490
Was I driving you crazy or
were you driving me crazy?

56
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:12,459
Why do you think I'm
taking you on this trip?

57
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:13,874
Thank you.

58
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:15,772
All right, but, listen, I just
don't want you all on top of me

59
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:17,809
when you see what
I'm taking you, OK?

60
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:19,776
Yeah, yeah, OK.

61
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:21,606
You're going to have
to behave yourself.

62
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,849
When's the last time
you saw me in a dress?

63
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:24,850
It's been a while.

64
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:25,955
Thank you for wearing it.

65
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:27,922
I'm surprised it still fits.

66
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:31,201
You look beautiful.

67
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:31,961
Thank you.

68
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:32,789
You're welcome.

69
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:33,514
Thank you.

70
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:34,826
Thank you.

71
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,552
I needed to
get out of that office.

72
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:38,347
Oh my god.

73
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:39,209
What are you doing?

74
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:41,142
You ready for this?

75
00:04:41,177 --> 00:04:42,558
What are you up to?

76
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:43,835
Would you stop trying
to figure everything out?

77
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:47,114
I told you, I want
this to be a surprise.

78
00:04:47,148 --> 00:04:49,358
So you're just going to get
out on the side of the road?

79
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:04,511
Bianca, what are you doing?

80
00:05:04,545 --> 00:05:05,719
You don't have to wear that.

81
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:06,858
Not up here.

82
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:09,136
You have to wear this.

83
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,758
I told you, I want
this to be a surprise.

84
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:14,072
The only way that's going to
work is by blindfolding you.

85
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:14,762
Please?

86
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:20,596
I cannot believe I'm going
to let you blindfold me.

87
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:26,774
I am the luckiest
man in the world.

88
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:33,988
Yeah you are, you've
got two minutes.

89
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:34,920
Two minutes.

90
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:36,853
All I need.

91
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:50,211
In my deep depress, I
am for a moment feels all up--

92
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:51,178
wanted.

93
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:53,214
Thought I was in control.

94
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:54,906
That's a trick back.

95
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,151
Thinking I had earned
love, going out bad.

96
00:05:59,186 --> 00:06:01,947
God, I'm scared of
me, afraid to speak.

97
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:03,673
I've noticed.

98
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,502
Every time--

99
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:05,848
All right, stay put.

100
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:07,090
Cannot believe
I let you blindfold me.

101
00:06:08,298 --> 00:06:09,817
It's
hard for me to see.

102
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:11,267
Too fast.

103
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:12,682
You've been good to us.

104
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:13,718
Mademoiselle.

105
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,446
You need your inhaler?

106
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:21,381
Thank you.

107
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:23,037
Just give me a second.

108
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,803
You OK?

109
00:06:29,837 --> 00:06:30,873
Come on, get out here.

110
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:32,461
Breathe some of this
clean mountain air.

111
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:34,221
Oh, two seconds away
from taking this thing off.

112
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:36,188
No, no, no, we're almost done.

113
00:06:36,223 --> 00:06:37,224
Five more steps.

114
00:06:37,258 --> 00:06:37,983
You're crazy.

115
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:39,537
I miss--

116
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:41,815
Step.

117
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:43,575
Two steps.

118
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,197
Lift up your right foot.

119
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:46,095
Right.

120
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:46,820
OK, I'm taking them off.

121
00:06:46,854 --> 00:06:48,166
No, not yet.

122
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,512
Trying to find the perfect spot.

123
00:06:49,547 --> 00:06:50,375
Stay right there.

124
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:53,827
Afraid that you got
to choose, help me decide.

125
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:54,517
ROM: OK.

126
00:06:57,244 --> 00:06:58,072
You ready?

127
00:06:58,107 --> 00:06:58,797
Oh yeah, I'm ready.

128
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:02,767
My tears-- will flow.

129
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:03,526
Take it off.

130
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:11,776
Oh, Rom.

131
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:17,437
It's beautiful.

132
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:21,026
What is this?

133
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,930
We're here to
celebrate your birthday.

134
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:35,144
I just figured everything that's
going on in the world right now

135
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:37,595
and me finally getting the
book to the publishers--

136
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:39,044
Happy birthday Bianca!

137
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,735
Bianca!

138
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:41,737
Oh my god.

139
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:45,119
Oh my god!

140
00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:45,982
Go say hi.

141
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:48,329
Come on, go, go, go!

142
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:49,814
What?

143
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:50,918
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday, baby.

144
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:54,404
Who?

145
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,129
Who do I give--

146
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:56,303
Me, me, me.

147
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:57,407
Happy birthday.

148
00:07:57,442 --> 00:07:58,201
Beautiful.

149
00:07:58,236 --> 00:07:59,202
Oh my god.

150
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:14,045
Oh!

151
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:19,947
Happy birthday!

152
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:20,948
Happy birthday!

153
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:21,915
Woo!

154
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:26,436
All right, guys, look
what we have for you.

155
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:27,299
Come on in.

156
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:28,059
- What?
- Wow.

157
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:29,060
Check It out.

158
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:30,026
Check it out.

159
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:30,820
Wow.

160
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:31,441
Look at this.

161
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:31,994
Look at that, huh?

162
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:36,067
What up, dog!

163
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:36,826
Ah.

164
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:37,586
Yeah, yeah.

165
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:38,966
Lou.

166
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,002
Hey.

167
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:41,037
Yes.

168
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:44,213
I am so sorry I'm late.

169
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:45,145
He didn't do it.

170
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:46,595
What do you mean?

171
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:47,527
Did you give him the ring?

172
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:48,597
He had the ring.

173
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:49,667
I think he got nervous.

174
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:50,460
Nervous?

175
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:51,289
Does she know?
Lou!

176
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,186
Hey.

177
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:53,809
Do my eyes deceive me?

178
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:56,190
Forest Park's finest Lou Powell.

179
00:08:56,225 --> 00:08:57,675
What up?

180
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:59,366
Ah, it means so much to me.

181
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,332
Thank you.

182
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:01,817
How could I not?

183
00:09:01,851 --> 00:09:03,404
Hey, when was the last
time all of us were together?

184
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:04,233
Year ago, Detroit.

185
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:05,372
I don't know.

186
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:06,546
Was it that night
at Coney Island?

187
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,064
Coney Island, yeah,
back in the day.

188
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:10,032
Oh my god.

189
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:10,964
I miss y'all.

190
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:11,965
The D's big three, yeah.

191
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:15,071
Yo, man, Lou wants
to talk to you.

192
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:16,038
What's up, Lou?

193
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:17,418
What happened?

194
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:18,454
Thanks, Russ.

195
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:20,214
You wasn't going to tell him.

196
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:21,940
Bro, everybody came here.

197
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:22,976
It was perfect.

198
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:23,563
What happened?

199
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:24,598
I don't know.

200
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:25,703
I can't believe I did it again.

201
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:26,911
Again?

202
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:29,016
How many proposals
have you botched?

203
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:30,811
Three, four, four.

204
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:31,881
Four?

205
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,434
This is number four,
lucky number four.

206
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:34,781
Well, at least
you're consistent.

207
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:35,885
It wasn't the right time.

208
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,506
Right time?

209
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,335
You had the ring?

210
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,094
I had the ring.

211
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:39,095
She was there?

212
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,614
Yeah.

213
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:41,546
So what the fuck you mean
it wasn't the right time.

214
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:43,962
Lou, Lou, Lou,
chill, chill, chill.

215
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:44,929
Look, look, look,
we're here for you.

216
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:45,723
We got tested.

217
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:47,103
We came here to support you.

218
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:50,210
Whatever goes down out
here, we're your boys.

219
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:50,969
Grow a pair.

220
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:51,487
Get a ring.

221
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:52,557
Hit a knee.

222
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,076
Let's put a ring
on her finger.

223
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,422
Can we do that, gentlemen?
That's what I'm saying.

224
00:09:55,456 --> 00:09:56,112
That's what I'm saying.
All right?

225
00:09:56,147 --> 00:09:57,424
All right.

226
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,598
OK, look, the weekend
is not over with.

227
00:09:58,632 --> 00:09:59,357
I'm going to find
the perfect time.

228
00:09:59,391 --> 00:09:59,944
Guys--

229
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:00,530
OK?

230
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:01,497
Just trust me.

231
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:02,671
Guys, guys, guys.

232
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:03,361
Big three from
the D. Let's get it.

233
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,742
Let's go.

234
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:05,605
I'm going to make it
happen, three from the D.

235
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,192
Big three from the D.

236
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:08,400
Big three from the D.

237
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:09,574
All right, everyone,
gather round.

238
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,333
Gather round.

239
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:11,507
Gather round.

240
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,060
Got the whole
weekend to catch up.

241
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:15,891
Now that we're all here, I'd
like to be the first to say,

242
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:18,065
welcome to the historic
Strawberry Lodge.

243
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,655
We've got this all to ourselves
for the entire weekend.

244
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,415
Not exactly the Four Seasons.

245
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,141
More like one season, fall--

246
00:10:25,176 --> 00:10:25,935
ing apart.

247
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:29,180
Oh, god, OK, come on, guys.

248
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:34,254
Thank you, Benny.

249
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:35,531
But we don't need that.

250
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:37,050
All right?

251
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:40,570
I would like you all to
meet the lovely Ms. Winrich.

252
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:41,468
Thank you.

253
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:42,676
Good evening, everyone.

254
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:46,093
And welcome to the
Strawberry Lodge.

255
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:48,648
I'm absolutely sure
that you'll all come

256
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:51,961
to love it as much as I do.

257
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:52,962
I'm so sorry.

258
00:10:52,997 --> 00:10:54,619
I didn't mean any
disrespect by it.

259
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,585
Sometimes, I just mess
around with Michael to bring

260
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,863
his ego down a few notches.

261
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:58,209
The place is actually
really beautiful.

262
00:10:58,243 --> 00:10:59,935
I took some pictures earlier.

263
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:01,833
Hm.

264
00:11:01,868 --> 00:11:05,699
Ms. Winrich was kind enough
to open up this entire lodge

265
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:09,461
especially for us and was
also the maestro in helping

266
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:10,877
make this an A1 weekend.

267
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:15,157
So, basically, be
nice, assholes.

268
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:19,437
I'd like to ask you to
gather together for one photo.

269
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:22,992
It's an old tradition
we have here.

270
00:11:23,027 --> 00:11:25,823
We like to memorialize
all who stay with us.

271
00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:28,239
That way, you never leave.

272
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:32,968
I feel like I'm in
"Get Out" right now.

273
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:34,832
All right, guys,
let's go, let's go.

274
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:36,350
All right, all right.

275
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:37,489
Don't dirty up my white.

276
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:38,214
I feel good.

277
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:39,146
I feel good.

278
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:39,699
Let me get on of you.

279
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,079
There you go.

280
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:43,910
All right, then on three,
one, two, oh.

281
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:45,256
Oh!

282
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:48,190
Can we do one more for us?

283
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:52,366
OK, shout out to the
time machine she used

284
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:54,714
to go get that Polaroid camera.

285
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:55,473
Three--

286
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,163
OK.

287
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:56,646
All right.

288
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:57,406
Thank you.

289
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,441
All right.

290
00:11:58,476 --> 00:11:59,132
Thank you.

291
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:02,204
You're going to the guest one.

292
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:03,032
Good to see you.

293
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:05,897
It's such a pleasure
to have you with us.

294
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:09,176
I want to welcome you
especially to Strawberry Lodge.

295
00:12:09,211 --> 00:12:10,730
Thank you.

296
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:14,388
You carry the light, my dear.

297
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:17,115
I can see it.

298
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,806
You're a beacon.

299
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:24,433
Congratulations.

300
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:26,055
Ah--

301
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,265
Yes, yes, we're all very proud
that Rom finished his new book.

302
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,888
In fact, you know what?

303
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:32,752
Before we leave, I'll
get you a signed copy.

304
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:33,683
How's that?

305
00:12:33,718 --> 00:12:35,168
That would be lovely.

306
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:36,963
And I have something
for you before I

307
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:38,309
leave you guys for the weekend.

308
00:12:38,343 --> 00:12:38,965
Me?

309
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:39,897
Yes.

310
00:12:39,931 --> 00:12:41,415
I'd like to give this to you.

311
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,865
It's our own bottle of wine.

312
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,660
This place just keeps
getting better and better.

313
00:12:44,694 --> 00:12:46,800
This is something we
give all our guests.

314
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:48,077
Thank you very much.

315
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:49,941
I'll make sure we toast
with this tonight.

316
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:55,084
Wow.

317
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:00,020
You know what?

318
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:00,883
Being out in the
mountains is probably

319
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:02,022
what the doctor ordered.

320
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:03,368
No, what the
doctor's ordered is

321
00:13:03,403 --> 00:13:05,474
for us to be social
distanced and sanitize

322
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:06,613
every time we blink.

323
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:08,788
Can you for once
stop being a nurse

324
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,237
and try to have a good time?

325
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:14,690
We're 106.

326
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:15,622
Here we go.

327
00:13:15,656 --> 00:13:18,590
Look, right here.

328
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:22,698
Whatever's in this
old ass room, woosah.

329
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:25,011
We're going to
appreciate it, all right?

330
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:25,701
All right.

331
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:29,739
Oh.

332
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:35,193
OK.

333
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:36,367
This is cool.

334
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:38,093
It's cute.

335
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:38,679
It's not bad.

336
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,421
What is she looking at?

337
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,746
White people are into
some strange shit.

338
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:23,586
You like it?

339
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:25,726
Yeah.

340
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:28,074
It's rustic, isn't it?

341
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:30,904
You know, this place
was built in 1838.

342
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:34,011
Burned down, got rebuilt in '53.

343
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:38,222
This looks like the
original furniture.

344
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:39,430
It's so beautiful.

345
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:42,951
And all the history here,
Native American culture,

346
00:14:42,985 --> 00:14:44,607
into the Spanish.

347
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:47,438
Gold rush happened right
here, just down all the way

348
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:49,129
from Sonora up to Tahoe.

349
00:14:53,754 --> 00:14:56,412
Everything OK?

350
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:59,036
You didn't have to do this.

351
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,623
I did.

352
00:15:00,658 --> 00:15:04,110
I did have to do this.

353
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:05,766
For you.

354
00:15:05,801 --> 00:15:06,836
For us.

355
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,321
My birthday was
a week ago, Rom.

356
00:15:08,355 --> 00:15:10,875
But these last couple
years have been crazy for us,

357
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,981
between you getting your
doctorate in religion

358
00:15:13,015 --> 00:15:18,089
and me finally finding
a little bit of success.

359
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:25,372
Besides, this place, there's
so much history right here.

360
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:27,098
OK, there you go.

361
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:30,377
So you're already writing
your next book now?

362
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:31,171
No, no, I--

363
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:32,310
I know what it looks like.

364
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:34,519
But I promise you,
it's not that.

365
00:15:34,554 --> 00:15:35,210
Hey.

366
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,768
I just wanted you to
have this trip to remind

367
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:45,530
you how special you are to me.

368
00:15:45,565 --> 00:15:48,844
My
dear, you're a beacon.

369
00:15:48,878 --> 00:15:49,534
Stop.

370
00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:57,957
Your nose, it's bleeding.

371
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:07,518
You OK

372
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:10,383
Yeah, fine.

373
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:11,246
Are you sure?

374
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,144
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

375
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:17,666
I'm going to go hang out with
the girls for a little bit.

376
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,701
Cool?

377
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:21,014
Yeah, totally cool.

378
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,445
Bye-bye, Mrs. Winrich.

379
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:39,929
She got a--

380
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,694
No, no, no, no, I correct you.

381
00:16:45,728 --> 00:16:47,765
As of two weeks
ago, Rom Jennings

382
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,905
is a bestselling author.

383
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:51,907
Did I not tell you
a year ago that we'd

384
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:54,047
be having this conversation?

385
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:56,843
What does it matter what
anyone says about this deal

386
00:16:56,877 --> 00:16:58,810
if I'm his agent?

387
00:16:58,845 --> 00:16:59,535
Hello?

388
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:01,261
Oh, you fucker.

389
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:01,917
Come on.

390
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,194
Give me a bar.

391
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:05,438
Give me a bar in this old bitch.

392
00:17:05,472 --> 00:17:06,025
Woo!

393
00:17:13,204 --> 00:17:13,653
Hey.

394
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:14,343
Hey, Mike.

395
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:20,453
I want you to forget
about what happened outside.

396
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:24,146
No, listen, do not give
yourself a hard time.

397
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:25,044
There's a lot of people.

398
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,149
That's a lot pressure.

399
00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:28,909
Rom, it's going to
be a great weekend.

400
00:17:28,944 --> 00:17:30,187
You're going to turn it around.

401
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:31,326
You're going to get
it done, all right?

402
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,259
It's going to work
out great, OK?

403
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:34,501
OK.

404
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:36,917
Listen, in other news,
the phone has been ringing.

405
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:38,850
And I know you've
been doing research.

406
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:41,232
I'm going to need an outline
from you sooner or later.

407
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:42,371
I don't want to talk
about that right now.

408
00:17:42,406 --> 00:17:43,717
- Rom, forget it.
- Not right now.

409
00:17:43,752 --> 00:17:44,649
I'm not even
talking about work.

410
00:17:44,684 --> 00:17:45,961
Who's talking about work?

411
00:17:45,995 --> 00:17:47,549
But-- I need fucking
outline, all right?

412
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,239
OK?

413
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:49,378
OK.

414
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:51,104
All right, listen, 30
minutes, I want everyone

415
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:53,831
changed over by the firepit.

416
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,074
I'll arrange something special.

417
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,385
It's going to be a vibe.

418
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,697
The girls are going
to love it, all right?

419
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:58,594
Thank you, Michael.

420
00:17:58,629 --> 00:17:59,319
I got you.

421
00:17:59,354 --> 00:18:00,320
We're good.

422
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:04,600
This place is
perfect for both of us.

423
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:05,946
Take this.

424
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:06,809
Go and have fun with
your friends, all right?

425
00:18:06,844 --> 00:18:08,570
Thanks.

426
00:18:13,989 --> 00:18:15,301
You know that
lady from earlier?

427
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:16,129
Mm-hm.

428
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:17,441
You think she's leaving soon?

429
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:20,237
Because she don't got
a sign on the desk.

430
00:18:20,271 --> 00:18:21,790
She's already left, babe.

431
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:25,311
But, apparently, it's
actually a really cool story.

432
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:28,037
So her family bought
the lodge when it first

433
00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:30,868
burnt down in the late 1800s.

434
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,041
They rebuilt what
was left of it.

435
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:33,595
They renamed it
Strawberry Lodge.

436
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:36,115
And now they rent it out
to people on the weekends.

437
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,530
Who told you all this?

438
00:18:37,564 --> 00:18:38,220
Rom.

439
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:42,949
What?

440
00:18:42,983 --> 00:18:45,054
Rom think he's so slick.

441
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:46,504
Why do you say that?

442
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:48,161
Rom brought us out here
to do research for his book.

443
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:50,819
This whole thing is like
the backdrop for another Rom

444
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:52,510
Jennings bestselling novel.

445
00:18:53,028 --> 00:18:53,718
Oh!

446
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,205
Stay right there.

447
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,696
You OK?

448
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,077
Guys, firepit, please.

449
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:10,701
Everyone's waiting.

450
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:12,461
All right, for
anybody who's interested,

451
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:14,877
this quaint little mountain town
that we're in right now used

452
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:16,948
to be part of Mexico
until 1848 when

453
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:18,364
it was ceded to United States.

454
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:21,884
And then became Strawberry,
California in '49,

455
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,300
during the Gold Rush.

456
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:25,543
Now, the gold
brought belligerent,

457
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:28,236
but determined
miners and outlaws,

458
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,240
fueled by whiskey and greed.

459
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:37,900
Now, they came here for one
reason and one reason only--

460
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:38,660
gold!

461
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:39,799
Oh my-- stop!

462
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:42,698
Stop.

463
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:43,768
You can't.

464
00:19:43,803 --> 00:19:45,080
Yo, I'mma go inside if y'all

465
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:45,943
keep going.

466
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:46,978
No, no, keep going.

467
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:47,669
Keep going, Rom.
Keep going.

468
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:51,673
And they got their
gold, all right.

469
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:55,332
So these miners began
to prey on the natives.

470
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:57,368
They went into their
villages and stole

471
00:19:57,403 --> 00:20:00,164
their women during the night.

472
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,650
And these women decided
they had had enough.

473
00:20:03,685 --> 00:20:05,445
And they made a pact.

474
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,830
They called themselves
las bruja and set it up

475
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:13,004
so they would control the town.

476
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,661
Documented reports
state that these women

477
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:16,491
were able to control
the miners minds

478
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:18,389
and make them hallucinate
to the point they

479
00:20:18,424 --> 00:20:20,529
were so frightened
they would kill

480
00:20:20,564 --> 00:20:22,531
themselves to escape the fear.

481
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:23,152
Bullshit.

482
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,811
Bro, why would
you tell us right

483
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:27,881
now when we've got to go sleep?

484
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:28,882
How am I going to sleep tonight?

485
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:31,471
Oh, that baby's scared.

486
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:34,681
I think we can all agree
that if we've learned anything,

487
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:38,167
it's that we've had to
face a lot of fears.

488
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:42,275
And I am so fucking
tired of being scared--

489
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,312
scared of going outside,
scared of taking

490
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:47,970
chances, scared of doing
the things we love.

491
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:50,835
So why don't we make a pact?

492
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:57,739
Let's all tell each other
our most personal fears

493
00:20:57,773 --> 00:21:01,121
and just let them go.

494
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:05,609
Fear will not rule
us here, not tonight.

495
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:06,437
Let's do it.

496
00:21:09,164 --> 00:21:11,787
I'll start.

497
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:15,239
When I was 18 years
old, I got hit by a car.

498
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,657
And in that moment,
I wasn't in control.

499
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:21,694
It was terrifying.

500
00:21:21,728 --> 00:21:26,250
And the only thing that didn't
break was this necklace.

501
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,218
So my greatest fear
is losing control.

502
00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:34,362
And as long as I
wear this necklace,

503
00:21:34,396 --> 00:21:37,123
no matter what life
brings me, I know that I'm

504
00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:39,056
going to be in control.

505
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,024
OK, who's next?

506
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,957
Birthday girl?

507
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:46,305
Where do I start?

508
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,790
Growing up in a
religious household,

509
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:52,759
I feared the consequences
of losing my faith.

510
00:21:52,794 --> 00:21:55,797
It's why I read a Bible
verse every night,

511
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:57,695
pray without ceasing.

512
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,491
Being an asthmatic, air
is so precious to me.

513
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:04,081
And now that air could kill me.

514
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,704
My biggest fear
has become losing

515
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:10,812
the thing I took for granted
the most, just breathing.

516
00:22:10,846 --> 00:22:12,192
Wow, OK.

517
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:13,539
I'll take-- I'll
take a shot at it.

518
00:22:13,573 --> 00:22:16,404
You know, where we
come from in Detroit,

519
00:22:16,438 --> 00:22:19,545
you know, there's not a lot
of options or opportunities.

520
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:23,618
I made a promise to
everyone that I would make

521
00:22:23,652 --> 00:22:26,137
it out of there no matter what.

522
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:28,347
And my word is my
bond, always has been.

523
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:33,386
What we're from, it'll
kill you if it isn't.

524
00:22:33,421 --> 00:22:38,978
So I have to say my biggest
fear is not being trusted,

525
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:41,705
especially by the people
who are depending on me.

526
00:22:46,675 --> 00:22:48,815
So back in the
day, Lou convinces

527
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:52,509
me and Rom to go to the movies
and see "Boyz n the Hood."

528
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:54,545
At the end of the movie when
Morris Chestnut is running

529
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,616
and he gets sprayed in
the chest and blood starts

530
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:58,031
flying all over the place--

531
00:22:58,066 --> 00:23:00,240
Oh, man, before me and
Lou had to carry you out,

532
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:01,932
you're staring at the
screen in a trance.

533
00:23:01,966 --> 00:23:03,140
And you just go, "Ricky!"

534
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:03,865
"Ricky!"

535
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:07,040
So good.

536
00:23:07,075 --> 00:23:09,284
What is your fear specifically?

537
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:10,734
My biggest fear is blood.

538
00:23:10,768 --> 00:23:14,462
There's just something about
it that I can't handle.

539
00:23:14,496 --> 00:23:17,534
So my biggest
fear, as a mother,

540
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:22,228
is honestly just not being
able to provide for my son.

541
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:25,127
My biggest fear is drowning.

542
00:23:25,162 --> 00:23:26,059
I can't swim.

543
00:23:26,094 --> 00:23:27,406
Except for baths.

544
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,856
This woman will take a
bath for three hours.

545
00:23:30,581 --> 00:23:31,927
Oh, man.

546
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:34,758
Claustrophobia, 100%.

547
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:37,657
When I was a kid, my
older brother used to lock

548
00:23:37,692 --> 00:23:39,659
me in the drawer under my bed.

549
00:23:39,694 --> 00:23:41,661
Used to be locked
in there for hours

550
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:44,181
in the dark flailing around.

551
00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:49,945
So, yeah, that's why I'm
getting cremated when I die.

552
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,880
Small, confined spaces,
coffins, not for me.

553
00:23:53,915 --> 00:23:56,227
I was in high school.

554
00:23:56,262 --> 00:23:57,574
I got pulled over.

555
00:23:57,608 --> 00:23:58,713
Cop didn't give me a reason.

556
00:23:58,747 --> 00:24:00,749
He just reached
inside my window,

557
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:04,373
snatched me out, slammed my
head on the hood of the car.

558
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:05,858
I was terrified.

559
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:10,932
So I say, fuck the cops
and fuck handcuffs.

560
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:13,313
That's easy for me.

561
00:24:13,348 --> 00:24:15,868
My biggest fear is losing you.

562
00:24:15,902 --> 00:24:17,352
Bullshit.

563
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:23,323
I'll tell you what, you
guys put this fire out.

564
00:24:23,358 --> 00:24:24,670
Let's set things up inside.

565
00:24:24,704 --> 00:24:25,981
I'm going to get
that bottle of wine

566
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:28,190
that the lovely Mrs.
Winrich gave us, yeah?

567
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:28,881
Woo!

568
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:30,123
To us.

569
00:24:30,158 --> 00:24:31,504
Best weekend of our lives.

570
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:34,334
Cheers to a great
weekend and happy birthday.

571
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,404
-Hey, Michael.
-What's up, Michael?

572
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:45,371
Where you been?

573
00:25:45,405 --> 00:25:45,992
We've been waiting on you.

574
00:25:46,027 --> 00:25:47,097
Michael.

575
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:53,172
Just, uh, so I know
I keep saying this,

576
00:25:53,206 --> 00:25:56,106
but you guys have no idea
what a great weekend we

577
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,728
have ahead of us.

578
00:25:57,763 --> 00:25:59,040
Thanks for all being here.

579
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:02,043
So let's, let's kind of
close this evening off

580
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:06,495
with a nice toast to
the birthday girl--

581
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,083
Thank you.

582
00:26:08,118 --> 00:26:11,742
-to new books, being with
people you love in crazy times.

583
00:26:11,777 --> 00:26:12,191
Yeah?

584
00:26:12,225 --> 00:26:13,364
Mm-hm.

585
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:14,020
All right, let's
get some glasses.

586
00:26:14,883 --> 00:26:15,815
What did she drink tonight?

587
00:26:16,782 --> 00:26:17,196
Whoa.

588
00:26:18,197 --> 00:26:19,163
There we go.

589
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:23,064
That's the spirit
we need though.

590
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:23,996
That's the spirit we need.

591
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,479
Hey.

592
00:26:24,513 --> 00:26:25,273
Cheers.

593
00:26:25,307 --> 00:26:25,963
Cheers.

594
00:26:25,998 --> 00:26:26,515
Cheers.

595
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,620
Yeah, salud.

596
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,415
Cheers.

597
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:30,312
Woo.

598
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:31,831
And to Bianca.

599
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,005
La familia.

600
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:33,557
Yes.

601
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:42,048
Oh.

602
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,463
Mm.

603
00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:45,845
Oh my god.

604
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,846
Mm.

605
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:48,814
Mm.

606
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:59,031
Yo, what the fuck
is in here, man?

607
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:01,689
The fuck?

608
00:27:01,723 --> 00:27:03,725
What the fuck is this shit?

609
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,933
This is why I
don't fucking drink.

610
00:27:04,968 --> 00:27:06,590
Please, just put
your glasses down.

611
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,936
Maybe it's just old wine?

612
00:27:07,971 --> 00:27:09,179
Let's just forget it happened.

613
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:10,352
Uh-uh.

614
00:27:10,387 --> 00:27:11,630
If anybody wants
to drink any more,

615
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:12,803
there's a couple more
bottles of champagne

616
00:27:12,838 --> 00:27:14,287
and a bottle of
tequila at the bar.

617
00:27:14,322 --> 00:27:16,151
It's got like a-- it's got
like an aftertaste to it.

618
00:27:16,186 --> 00:27:17,290
Let's go.

619
00:27:17,325 --> 00:27:18,153
Sandpaper or something.

620
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:19,327
Guys!

621
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:20,259
No, but seriously,
what was that?

622
00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:21,156
I have no idea.

623
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:21,916
What did it taste like?

624
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,675
Uh, man, go.

625
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,125
Throw that shit away, man.

626
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,058
I will.

627
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:27,818
It's disgusting, man.

628
00:27:27,853 --> 00:27:28,439
1938?

629
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:55,812
God's word is sure.

630
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:58,607
When God begins to
speak,

631
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:00,989
will rise up and live.

632
00:28:01,024 --> 00:28:03,923
And things that ought to be
dead will lay down and die.

633
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:08,687
When the word of the lord God
can speak a word to you and and

634
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:09,757
shall be healed!

635
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:11,551
Hey, I'm sorry about the wine.

636
00:28:14,002 --> 00:28:16,315
How do we know everyone got
tested before we came up here?

637
00:28:18,835 --> 00:28:19,801
Because everyone got tested.

638
00:28:19,836 --> 00:28:21,147
What are you talking about?

639
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:22,321
I mean, how do we know?

640
00:28:22,355 --> 00:28:24,150
Because I arranged the test.

641
00:28:24,185 --> 00:28:24,806
That's how we know.

642
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:25,565
What's the problem?

643
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,533
Lou.

644
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:28,327
What about Lou?

645
00:28:28,361 --> 00:28:29,880
Lou is sick.

646
00:28:29,915 --> 00:28:31,019
Dude, Lou's not sick.

647
00:28:31,054 --> 00:28:32,711
He got tested like
everyone else.

648
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:33,988
And how do you know he
physically went and got tested?

649
00:28:34,022 --> 00:28:35,644
Bro, I'm telling you,
I've been watching him.

650
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,405
Ever since we got here,
he's been coughing.

651
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:39,925
And not just easy cough, like
he's been coughing up a lung.

652
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:40,891
I'm telling you, he's sick--

653
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:42,203
Benny, Benny, relax, relax.

654
00:28:42,237 --> 00:28:44,343
On my way to bed,
I will go and check

655
00:28:44,377 --> 00:28:45,931
on Lou, make sure he's OK.

656
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:50,142
I need you to concentrate on
having a good time, all right?

657
00:28:50,176 --> 00:28:51,557
Relax.

658
00:28:51,591 --> 00:28:53,317
And if
god is panicking, oh my god.

659
00:28:53,352 --> 00:28:55,803
You may as well slit your
wrists and your throat.

660
00:29:07,504 --> 00:29:09,506
What are you doing?

661
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,681
Mrs. Winrich low
key got some classics.

662
00:29:12,716 --> 00:29:14,373
Let me find out.

663
00:29:15,408 --> 00:29:17,617
Oh, oh, baby girl.

664
00:29:20,897 --> 00:29:23,451
You ain't getting
none to that music.

665
00:29:23,485 --> 00:29:24,970
We'll see about that.

666
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:29,146
Good night.

667
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:29,837
Good night.

668
00:29:29,871 --> 00:29:31,459
Sorry about the wine.

669
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:33,633
No worries.

670
00:29:34,842 --> 00:29:38,293
Hey, Lou, what a night, huh?

671
00:29:41,296 --> 00:29:42,021
What up, doe?

672
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:47,371
Listen, I want to
ask you a question.

673
00:29:47,406 --> 00:29:48,821
Don't take it personally.

674
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:50,616
I feel very stupid even asking.

675
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,066
Nah, no stupid
questions, go ahead.

676
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,894
Shoot.

677
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:54,758
OK, OK, how are you feeling?

678
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,759
You feeling all right?

679
00:29:58,451 --> 00:29:59,556
What?

680
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,453
How am I feeling?

681
00:30:00,488 --> 00:30:01,765
I feel fine.

682
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,388
Yeah, you know, not
me, you know, a couple

683
00:30:04,423 --> 00:30:05,424
of-- a couple of the others--

684
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:06,839
A couple of the others?

685
00:30:06,874 --> 00:30:08,565
Yeah, a couple of the
other guys mentioned they

686
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,462
saw you coughing--

687
00:30:09,497 --> 00:30:10,739
So you came up here--

688
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:11,499
Absolutely not.

689
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:12,258
-to accuse--

690
00:30:12,293 --> 00:30:13,087
Absolutely not.

691
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:15,192
-me of being contagious--

692
00:30:15,227 --> 00:30:16,331
No--

693
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:18,402
-of a disease and
being willing to spread

694
00:30:18,437 --> 00:30:19,956
it to my closest friends.

695
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,267
That's what you're saying?

696
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:22,959
No, I'm just trying
to keep everything safe.

697
00:30:22,993 --> 00:30:25,478
What gives you the right
to come up here and check me?

698
00:30:25,513 --> 00:30:26,825
Just crossing the--

699
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:28,447
crossing the T, dotting
the I's, making sure--

700
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:31,484
Nah, man, I'm going to
dot your I. How about that?

701
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:34,004
How about I dot your I.

702
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,040
Mm--

703
00:30:35,074 --> 00:30:36,248
Man, get out from
in front of my door.

704
00:30:36,282 --> 00:30:36,973
I feel fine.

705
00:30:37,007 --> 00:30:38,491
There's no need to get--

706
00:30:38,526 --> 00:30:39,561
I took a test just like all
of you other motherfuckers

707
00:30:39,596 --> 00:30:40,390
took a test.

708
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:41,632
Fuck out my face.

709
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:44,014
Squirrely mouth
looking motherfucker.

710
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:46,637
It's been good that
we've been getting

711
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:47,880
closer over the last few years.

712
00:30:47,915 --> 00:30:48,985
You're still here?

713
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:49,675
I'm going.
I'm going.

714
00:30:49,709 --> 00:30:50,572
Goodnight.

715
00:30:50,607 --> 00:30:52,298
If you need anything.

716
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:54,645
Please come home.

717
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:00,548
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby girl.

718
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,598
Murder-suicide, suicide,

719
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:18,186
suicide.

720
00:31:18,221 --> 00:31:19,153
Murder-suicide.

721
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,468
Murder-suicide.

722
00:31:24,503 --> 00:31:26,401
Suicide, suicide.

723
00:31:26,436 --> 00:31:27,713
The body of a woman inside.

724
00:31:27,747 --> 00:31:29,025
It's playing backwards.

725
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:30,336
Murder-suicide.

726
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:33,270
Suicide, suicide.

727
00:31:34,444 --> 00:31:35,894
The
body of a woman inside.

728
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:39,587
Double murder-suicide.

729
00:31:52,807 --> 00:31:54,153
Why would
she give us that?

730
00:31:54,188 --> 00:31:56,500
I'm going to say something
when she gets back.

731
00:31:56,535 --> 00:31:58,813
I mean, that was the weirdest
thing I've ever seen.

732
00:31:58,847 --> 00:32:00,090
Mm-hm.

733
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,747
I mean, it just totally
ruined everything.

734
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:02,437
Totally.

735
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,511
It seems like
such a sick joke.

736
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:51,072
What do we do when we are
overwhelmed by evil thoughts?

737
00:32:51,107 --> 00:32:52,418
Where do they come from?

738
00:32:52,453 --> 00:32:54,800
And, more importantly,
how do they influence

739
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:57,044
our emotions and our actions?

740
00:34:21,783 --> 00:34:23,199
In my
research, people

741
00:34:23,233 --> 00:34:26,443
have described the most
violence and horrific thoughts

742
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:27,893
that they had.

743
00:34:27,927 --> 00:34:32,242
But what is more frightening is
the sources of these ideations.

744
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,528
Angel of death?

745
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:43,451
"Wine used as
initiation ritual."

746
00:35:50,631 --> 00:35:51,321
Angel Wilson.

747
00:35:56,326 --> 00:35:57,016
That's great.

748
00:35:57,051 --> 00:35:58,501
Turn around.

749
00:35:58,535 --> 00:35:59,950
Aw, Angel.

750
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,506
What?

751
00:36:11,617 --> 00:36:12,273
Wow.

752
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:16,760
This has got to be the place.

753
00:36:37,436 --> 00:36:38,126
Found it.

754
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:48,654
What is this?

755
00:36:48,689 --> 00:36:50,794
"By feeding these souls
of light to the portal,

756
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:54,142
the gatekeeper will
be granted immortality

757
00:36:54,177 --> 00:36:57,422
to fulfill their infinite
bondage to darkness?"

758
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,017
"Believing what you fear
will bring to the victim

759
00:37:07,052 --> 00:37:09,261
what they are afraid of."

760
00:37:55,514 --> 00:37:59,069
"Once the ritual of la
uva, the grape, is completed,

761
00:37:59,104 --> 00:38:00,899
the collecting of
souls may begin."

762
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:20,599
You OK?

763
00:39:20,634 --> 00:39:22,325
Yeah.

764
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,120
You left the kettle on.

765
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,604
I was making tea.

766
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,641
OK.

767
00:39:27,675 --> 00:39:31,541
Hey, you guys got
to see this right now.

768
00:39:45,313 --> 00:39:46,694
Public health officials

769
00:39:46,729 --> 00:39:49,835
announced that a mysterious
airborne contagion has

770
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,597
been identified as
the next major health

771
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:54,668
crisis in global society.

772
00:39:54,702 --> 00:39:57,947
Its origin is unknown and
is spreading at a rate

773
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:59,638
like we've never seen.

774
00:39:59,673 --> 00:40:01,951
Minutes ago, Washington
has confirmed

775
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:04,885
that multiple infections
of this deadly disease

776
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:07,784
have been confirmed in both
the East and West Coast.

777
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,479
The CDC warns
Americans take it serious.

778
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:16,344
The director of the CDC
has warned all Americans

779
00:40:16,379 --> 00:40:17,794
to prepare for the worst.

780
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:20,763
Whatever you do,
do not go outside.

781
00:40:22,558 --> 00:40:24,974
Secure all windows and doors.

782
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:26,562
Fear it.

783
00:40:26,596 --> 00:40:30,807
The air is contaminated Droplets
can spread within seconds.

784
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:34,259
This airborne virus can
cause death within hours.

785
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:35,709
Fuck.

786
00:40:35,743 --> 00:40:37,124
Make sure
that you are cautious--

787
00:40:37,158 --> 00:40:39,575
We're basically trapped
in this lodge indefinitely.

788
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:42,232
After all these months and
now we can't even go outside?

789
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:44,096
We can't go outside.

790
00:40:44,131 --> 00:40:47,548
The people you are in
contact with are infected.

791
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:49,136
It might only be
a couple of days.

792
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:49,930
How do you know that?

793
00:40:49,964 --> 00:40:50,793
I don't.

794
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:51,966
I'm just hopeful.

795
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:52,864
Well, let's get real.

796
00:40:52,898 --> 00:40:53,830
Let's talk about it.

797
00:40:53,865 --> 00:40:55,004
Talk about what?

798
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:56,971
Who is missing?

799
00:40:57,006 --> 00:40:58,490
What do you mean, Benny?

800
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:00,043
Why don't you look around
and tell me who's missing?

801
00:41:02,356 --> 00:41:03,253
Oh.

802
00:41:03,288 --> 00:41:04,323
Mike, say something.

803
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:05,221
Russ, say something.

804
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:06,118
You guys talk to him.

805
00:41:06,153 --> 00:41:07,188
Lou is sick.

806
00:41:07,223 --> 00:41:08,086
I mean, why are
you doing this?

807
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,259
Doing what?

808
00:41:09,294 --> 00:41:10,951
He told you that
he has allergies.

809
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:13,678
He is infected, Rom.

810
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:17,129
Whatever the new
variant is, he has it.

811
00:41:17,164 --> 00:41:19,097
Yeah, he looked,
he looked sick.

812
00:41:19,131 --> 00:41:21,306
Hey, Russ, are you
buying into this bullshit?

813
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,480
I don't know, man.

814
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:24,378
He told us that
he's got allergies.

815
00:41:24,412 --> 00:41:25,448
Why would he lie to us?

816
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,415
He's our family.

817
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,934
That's why we're here.

818
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:30,108
No, we're here because you
two brought us in the middle

819
00:41:30,142 --> 00:41:31,592
of fucking nowhere.

820
00:41:31,627 --> 00:41:32,731
No, we were trying to do
something nice for someone.

821
00:41:32,766 --> 00:41:33,801
It was someone's birthday.

822
00:41:33,836 --> 00:41:35,009
No hospital.

823
00:41:35,044 --> 00:41:36,563
Don't turn it around to
something that it wasn't.

824
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,461
Symptoms include
hallucination,

825
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,981
coughing, and dry mouth.

826
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:44,502
You're
all going to die.

827
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:46,296
This is probably the safest
place that we could be.

828
00:41:46,331 --> 00:41:47,712
It's the safest place?

829
00:41:47,746 --> 00:41:50,128
No hospital, no pharmacy,
no internet reception?

830
00:41:50,162 --> 00:41:51,060
No fucking people.

831
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:51,957
No disease.

832
00:41:51,992 --> 00:41:53,131
No virus.

833
00:41:53,165 --> 00:41:54,304
I'm not dying because of
your lack of leadership.

834
00:41:57,376 --> 00:41:58,343
What you wanna do?

835
00:41:58,377 --> 00:41:59,102
It's OK.

836
00:41:59,137 --> 00:41:59,965
You were sick.

837
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,070
Hey, knock it off.

838
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,658
We did not come this
far to watch us fucking

839
00:42:02,692 --> 00:42:05,143
have a mental breakdown.

840
00:42:05,177 --> 00:42:10,251
We need to take a deep breath
and figure out our options.

841
00:42:10,286 --> 00:42:11,011
You saw Lou.

842
00:42:11,045 --> 00:42:11,667
How did he look?

843
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,776
When I saw Lou last
night, he did not look good.

844
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:20,227
When you talked to
Lou, was he sick or not?

845
00:42:20,261 --> 00:42:23,748
I'm not a doctor, but I
would say that Lou is sick.

846
00:42:23,782 --> 00:42:25,439
I'm sorry to say,
his symptoms are

847
00:42:25,473 --> 00:42:26,682
in line with the new strain.

848
00:42:26,716 --> 00:42:29,167
Guys, the only
sensible thing to do

849
00:42:29,201 --> 00:42:30,893
is to get Lou out of this house.

850
00:42:30,927 --> 00:42:31,790
I agree.

851
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:32,377
Excuse me.

852
00:42:32,411 --> 00:42:33,378
I agree.

853
00:42:33,412 --> 00:42:34,793
You heard what the CDC said.

854
00:42:34,828 --> 00:42:37,106
There's some crazy
stuff going on outside.

855
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,107
Yeah, I heard what they said.

856
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:39,522
He's staying here.

857
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,075
And you're going to
decide that for everyone?

858
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,007
You're damn right.

859
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:42,974
How is that fair?

860
00:42:43,008 --> 00:42:44,044
Maybe you're sick.

861
00:42:44,078 --> 00:42:44,734
How about that, Michael?

862
00:42:44,769 --> 00:42:46,080
Maybe you have to go.

863
00:42:46,115 --> 00:42:46,840
I don't feel sick.

864
00:42:48,013 --> 00:42:49,670
Hey, guys.

865
00:42:49,705 --> 00:42:51,983
Kimmy, what are you doing?

866
00:42:52,017 --> 00:42:54,019
I'm-- I'm leaving.

867
00:42:54,054 --> 00:42:55,400
You can't go now.

868
00:42:55,434 --> 00:42:57,505
Listen, I have
space in the back

869
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,715
if anyone wants to
come and join me.

870
00:43:02,407 --> 00:43:04,374
Fuck.

871
00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:06,929
Have you seen the news?

872
00:43:06,963 --> 00:43:08,724
No mask is going to
protect you from that.

873
00:43:08,758 --> 00:43:10,242
The air is contaminated.

874
00:43:10,277 --> 00:43:12,037
People are dying outside, Kimmy.

875
00:43:12,072 --> 00:43:14,626
My son is at home
with this babysitter.

876
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:17,491
I can't even get through to her.

877
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:19,597
I have to be at
home with my son.

878
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:20,977
They said you
can't go outside.

879
00:43:21,012 --> 00:43:22,254
It's not--

880
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:25,223
Benny, Benny, people, if
she wants to go, let her go.

881
00:43:25,257 --> 00:43:26,396
She's got a kid at home.

882
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:28,191
My gosh, she's got
kid at home you

883
00:43:28,226 --> 00:43:29,296
cannot go out there like that.

884
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:30,400
What choice do I have?

885
00:43:30,435 --> 00:43:31,643
It's not safe.

886
00:43:31,678 --> 00:43:32,230
You don't know what
you're up against.

887
00:43:32,264 --> 00:43:32,989
Just--

888
00:43:33,024 --> 00:43:34,508
That's my son.

889
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:36,614
And you would do the
exact same thing.

890
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:40,963
It doesn't make
any fucking sense.

891
00:43:40,997 --> 00:43:41,929
I love you.

892
00:43:41,964 --> 00:43:42,585
I love you all.

893
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,759
Just be safe.

894
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:51,698
You're just going
to let her go?

895
00:43:51,732 --> 00:43:53,423
Baby, she has a kid, baby.

896
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:54,701
Come on.

897
00:43:54,735 --> 00:43:56,737
No, we-- we can't
just let her go.

898
00:43:56,772 --> 00:44:01,328
We have to let her go,
B. It's poison out there.

899
00:44:01,362 --> 00:44:03,295
You can't risk it.

900
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,676
All of this is crazy, bro.

901
00:44:04,711 --> 00:44:06,298
How do we know that
we're not infected?

902
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:09,336
Because we're not sick, Russ.

903
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,165
Because we're fine.

904
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,235
We're fine.

905
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,789
How do you know
that we're fine?

906
00:44:13,823 --> 00:44:16,584
The CDC said the symptoms of
paranoia and hallucination.

907
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:18,414
I know I am not
the only one that's

908
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:21,520
seeing things in this lodge.

909
00:44:23,902 --> 00:44:27,216
I've been seeing things too.

910
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:27,906
What?

911
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:35,293
What did you see?

912
00:44:35,327 --> 00:44:36,984
It's not important.

913
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:38,537
Maybe you just
need a little rest.

914
00:44:38,572 --> 00:44:41,713
I saw some shit.

915
00:44:41,748 --> 00:44:45,579
Sorry.

916
00:44:45,613 --> 00:44:50,998
I'm fine.

917
00:44:51,033 --> 00:44:51,792
It's asthma.

918
00:44:55,658 --> 00:44:58,557
It's asthma.

919
00:44:58,592 --> 00:45:01,181
Serena, you know it's asthma.

920
00:45:01,215 --> 00:45:02,630
Serena?

921
00:45:02,665 --> 00:45:03,873
I just-- my inhaler.

922
00:45:03,908 --> 00:45:05,392
Serena, you know it's Bianca.

923
00:45:05,426 --> 00:45:06,738
She's got asthma.

924
00:45:06,773 --> 00:45:07,739
Can you help her out?
All right, yeah, yeah.

925
00:45:07,774 --> 00:45:09,361
This is what we need to do.

926
00:45:09,396 --> 00:45:12,468
You guys get her upstairs, let
her get a little bit of rest.

927
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:15,643
Guys, we're in this together.

928
00:45:15,678 --> 00:45:18,370
Guys, do not let
this break us apart.

929
00:45:18,405 --> 00:45:19,786
Let's not lose control.

930
00:45:23,928 --> 00:45:26,827
All right, all
right, all right.

931
00:45:26,862 --> 00:45:28,035
You're going to lie back here.

932
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:29,381
Go on.

933
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:30,969
Deep breath.

934
00:45:35,284 --> 00:45:37,010
Hope Kimmy makes it.

935
00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:50,230
Bianca, do you
think you're sick?

936
00:45:55,614 --> 00:45:56,305
No.

937
00:45:58,617 --> 00:45:59,273
OK.

938
00:46:02,898 --> 00:46:04,554
Wait, get my bag for me.

939
00:46:04,589 --> 00:46:05,245
Yeah.

940
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,405
You're pregnant.

941
00:46:33,998 --> 00:46:36,241
When did you find out?

942
00:46:36,276 --> 00:46:38,381
Three weeks ago, maybe.

943
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:40,107
You know, I--

944
00:46:40,142 --> 00:46:41,177
I just knew.

945
00:46:42,316 --> 00:46:45,043
Does Rom know?

946
00:46:45,078 --> 00:46:45,803
No.

947
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:48,806
OK.

948
00:46:51,705 --> 00:46:54,777
I-- I mean, there's
so much going on.

949
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,400
I haven't found the
right time, I guess.

950
00:46:57,435 --> 00:46:58,746
I don't know.

951
00:46:58,781 --> 00:47:03,821
And then he's just not
here, it feels like.

952
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:19,975
Hey Lou, how are you doing?

953
00:47:24,117 --> 00:47:26,291
Everybody lost their
minds over this virus.

954
00:47:26,326 --> 00:47:28,673
Think I'm infected, huh?

955
00:47:28,707 --> 00:47:29,467
I'm not dumb.

956
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:33,712
And Michael coming
up here trying,

957
00:47:33,747 --> 00:47:35,335
trying to figure me out.

958
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:36,888
He's paranoid.

959
00:47:36,923 --> 00:47:38,407
We're paranoid.

960
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:40,685
And everybody thinks they're
a doctor all of a sudden.

961
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:42,825
I think maybe we all have it.

962
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:47,416
Hey, listen, man, I
told you, on my life,

963
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:50,384
I quarantined two
weeks before this trip.

964
00:47:50,419 --> 00:47:51,765
It's my allergies, you know?

965
00:47:51,799 --> 00:47:54,009
I already gave y'all
the God's honest truth.

966
00:47:54,043 --> 00:47:56,287
I know you did, Lou.

967
00:47:56,321 --> 00:47:57,771
I would never doubt you.

968
00:48:06,228 --> 00:48:09,748
Looking for a
tarp, tape, anything

969
00:48:09,783 --> 00:48:11,336
we can block windows up with.

970
00:48:18,757 --> 00:48:19,482
Fuck off.

971
00:48:22,244 --> 00:48:24,142
Yo, it's kind of
creepy down here.

972
00:48:24,177 --> 00:48:25,937
Benny, Benny, come on, huh?

973
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:39,261
Yo, Mike.

974
00:48:39,295 --> 00:48:40,262
What?

975
00:48:40,296 --> 00:48:41,642
Come here.

976
00:48:41,677 --> 00:48:42,989
Looks like something back here.

977
00:48:43,023 --> 00:48:43,921
Hold on, watch out.

978
00:49:03,423 --> 00:49:06,702
We're going to figure
a way out of this.

979
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:10,671
Yeah, we always do.

980
00:49:10,706 --> 00:49:12,225
Since eighth grade, right?

981
00:49:12,259 --> 00:49:13,329
Yeah.

982
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:16,091
Listen, well, when
I look in your eyes

983
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:21,061
and I see the look
in her eyes, I could

984
00:49:21,096 --> 00:49:24,375
tell you found the one, bro.

985
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:25,410
Don't fuck this up.

986
00:49:25,445 --> 00:49:27,792
You know we came
here for a show, man.

987
00:49:27,826 --> 00:49:30,691
So before this weekend's over,
there better be fireworks.

988
00:49:30,726 --> 00:49:31,865
You understand me?

989
00:49:31,899 --> 00:49:33,591
I'm going to get it done, Lou.

990
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:35,489
Don't be afraid of commitment.

991
00:49:35,524 --> 00:49:41,875
You don't
want to be like me,

992
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:48,986
coming home to an empty house
every night, no kids, no woman,

993
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,437
no one to take care of you.

994
00:49:52,472 --> 00:49:53,852
Fear is a choice.

995
00:49:53,887 --> 00:49:55,061
Don't believe in it.

996
00:49:58,754 --> 00:49:59,927
All right?

997
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,311
Now, be out.

998
00:50:04,346 --> 00:50:06,693
I'll be much better
after I get some rest.

999
00:50:06,727 --> 00:50:10,248
Go tell them that.

1000
00:50:12,043 --> 00:50:14,080
Yo, Mike, come here?

1001
00:50:20,672 --> 00:50:21,846
What you got there?

1002
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,674
I don't know.

1003
00:50:22,709 --> 00:50:23,744
About to find out.

1004
00:50:23,779 --> 00:50:26,368
It's got to be
stuff behind it.

1005
00:50:43,764 --> 00:50:44,869
I'm so glad you guys are here.

1006
00:50:44,903 --> 00:50:45,594
Me too.

1007
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:51,186
What?

1008
00:51:02,024 --> 00:51:06,546
It's probably an
allergic reaction, right?

1009
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,271
Not a symptom.

1010
00:51:14,761 --> 00:51:17,764
OK, enough about me.

1011
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:19,938
You want me to get you
something for your stomach?

1012
00:51:19,973 --> 00:51:20,767
Some tea?

1013
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:21,492
Yeah.

1014
00:51:42,444 --> 00:51:43,893
Why is there a bed down here?

1015
00:51:43,928 --> 00:51:44,894
It's fucking weird.

1016
00:51:44,929 --> 00:51:46,793
It's an old lodge, isn't it?

1017
00:51:46,827 --> 00:51:48,174
Lots of shit down here.

1018
00:51:50,866 --> 00:51:52,385
There's no windows
here, is there?

1019
00:51:52,419 --> 00:51:53,524
No.

1020
00:51:53,558 --> 00:51:55,974
So no ventilation to
the rest of the house.

1021
00:52:04,776 --> 00:52:05,777
Did you get a hold of Kim yet?

1022
00:52:05,812 --> 00:52:07,503
No, I've called.

1023
00:52:07,538 --> 00:52:08,297
I've texted.

1024
00:52:08,332 --> 00:52:09,885
It just goes to voicemail.

1025
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:11,576
Maybe she doesn't
have reception.

1026
00:52:11,611 --> 00:52:12,301
I don't know.

1027
00:52:58,727 --> 00:52:59,383
Bianca.

1028
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:04,181
What?

1029
00:53:08,357 --> 00:53:09,047
What?

1030
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:18,988
Oh.

1031
00:53:19,023 --> 00:53:20,611
What?

1032
00:53:20,645 --> 00:53:23,130
My necklace, I must
have dropped it in here.

1033
00:53:23,165 --> 00:53:23,959
I just had it.

1034
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:25,132
Have you seen it?

1035
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:26,479
No, no, I don't
think you had it on.

1036
00:53:26,513 --> 00:53:28,895
No, I wear my necklace
all the time, Bianca.

1037
00:53:28,929 --> 00:53:29,999
Calm down immediately.

1038
00:53:30,034 --> 00:53:33,693
No, I literally just had it.

1039
00:53:33,727 --> 00:53:35,453
Why are you looking
at me like I'm sick?

1040
00:53:35,488 --> 00:53:37,593
It's a rash from an
allergic reaction.

1041
00:53:37,628 --> 00:53:38,663
Just calm down.

1042
00:53:38,698 --> 00:53:41,494
Just had my necklace
and now it's gone.

1043
00:53:58,027 --> 00:53:59,236
Hey, hold this for a second.

1044
00:54:06,312 --> 00:54:09,211
Are those empty bottles
of that shitty wine we had?

1045
00:54:14,665 --> 00:54:15,113
Yeah, Russ.

1046
00:54:15,148 --> 00:54:15,804
Fuck.

1047
00:54:18,462 --> 00:54:20,187
What you got down there, Benny?

1048
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:23,984
Looks like some old
chest,..

1049
00:54:24,019 --> 00:54:28,023
I don't see
anything good, man.

1050
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:30,197
Russ, Hold up a second.

1051
00:54:37,204 --> 00:54:40,518
"Believing what you fear
will bring to the victim

1052
00:54:40,553 --> 00:54:43,072
what they are afraid of."

1053
00:54:43,107 --> 00:54:43,763
This is it.

1054
00:54:56,776 --> 00:54:58,950
Upstairs
room isn't sealed.

1055
00:54:58,985 --> 00:55:00,883
Obviously, not waterproof.

1056
00:55:00,918 --> 00:55:05,405
Lou, I know he's your
friend, but he is sick.

1057
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,406
There's a room down here.

1058
00:55:06,441 --> 00:55:07,718
We can easily put him in there.

1059
00:55:09,961 --> 00:55:13,137
There's no ventilation
to the rest of the house.

1060
00:55:13,171 --> 00:55:17,003
We can get food and
water down to him.

1061
00:55:17,037 --> 00:55:17,900
I don't want to get sick.

1062
00:55:44,893 --> 00:55:46,412
What is this?

1063
00:55:46,446 --> 00:55:49,760
Benny, can I talk
to you real quick?

1064
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:03,843
Hey.

1065
00:56:10,608 --> 00:56:11,022
Rom.

1066
00:56:11,057 --> 00:56:11,713
What?

1067
00:56:14,232 --> 00:56:16,649
I'm sorry.

1068
00:56:16,683 --> 00:56:18,582
I'm listening.

1069
00:56:18,616 --> 00:56:19,134
Are you?

1070
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:20,929
Yeah, I promise.

1071
00:56:20,963 --> 00:56:23,552
Something's wrong.

1072
00:56:23,587 --> 00:56:24,242
Listen.

1073
00:56:24,277 --> 00:56:25,899
I don't know what it is.

1074
00:56:25,934 --> 00:56:27,073
Babe, listen to me.

1075
00:56:27,107 --> 00:56:28,246
Last night when
I couldn't sleep,

1076
00:56:28,281 --> 00:56:29,455
I ended up running
around the house.

1077
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:30,490
And I ended up in
the basement when

1078
00:56:30,525 --> 00:56:32,112
I found these photos and books.

1079
00:56:32,147 --> 00:56:34,460
And-- you got to listen to this.

1080
00:56:34,494 --> 00:56:36,531
"Seeking those of
light and sourcing

1081
00:56:36,565 --> 00:56:41,708
fears from each soul for
fear and faith are the same."

1082
00:56:41,743 --> 00:56:43,848
We are trapped.

1083
00:56:43,883 --> 00:56:45,436
You hear me?

1084
00:56:45,471 --> 00:56:48,301
We're in this weird ass
lodge in this weird ass

1085
00:56:48,335 --> 00:56:50,407
town in the middle of nowhere.

1086
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:51,546
We can't go outside.

1087
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,133
You guys saw the news.

1088
00:56:53,168 --> 00:56:56,551
We have no idea what this mist
will do if we walk into it.

1089
00:56:56,585 --> 00:56:59,485
And I'm not trying to
die being a character

1090
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:02,591
in one of Rom's books.

1091
00:57:02,626 --> 00:57:07,113
The way we're going to go
down is from the inside out.

1092
00:57:07,147 --> 00:57:10,875
And the only person that's
showing symptoms right now

1093
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:12,187
is Lou.

1094
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:13,637
So here's what
we're going to do.

1095
00:57:13,671 --> 00:57:16,294
We're going to put Lou
down here in this basement.

1096
00:57:16,329 --> 00:57:17,261
Do you hear yourself?

1097
00:57:17,295 --> 00:57:18,158
I know.

1098
00:57:18,193 --> 00:57:19,297
Lou is my best friend.

1099
00:57:19,332 --> 00:57:22,646
I love Lou more
than anybody here.

1100
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,545
We need to bring Lou
to this basement.

1101
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,410
And we need to lock that
motherfucking door until we

1102
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,584
can figure this shit out.

1103
00:57:29,618 --> 00:57:31,033
Listen to yourself.

1104
00:57:31,068 --> 00:57:33,691
We're going to put him
down here in a basement?

1105
00:57:33,726 --> 00:57:35,037
It will only be for one night.

1106
00:57:35,072 --> 00:57:37,626
Lou would do the exact
same to us if he had to.

1107
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:39,317
We've got to look
out for the girls

1108
00:57:39,352 --> 00:57:41,596
and we've got to look
out for the group.

1109
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:44,668
You mean you got to do
what's best for yourself?

1110
00:57:47,394 --> 00:57:48,499
Mike, you with me?

1111
00:57:52,952 --> 00:57:53,608
Benny you in?

1112
00:57:58,336 --> 00:57:59,372
Benny, look at me.

1113
00:57:59,406 --> 00:58:00,546
Are you in?

1114
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,893
And what if he
don't want to come?

1115
00:58:02,927 --> 00:58:05,999
If it's between him
and us, we're going

1116
00:58:06,034 --> 00:58:07,345
to make him come down here.

1117
00:58:09,831 --> 00:58:11,384
Let's go.

1118
00:58:11,418 --> 00:58:12,074
Come on, Benny.

1119
00:58:16,596 --> 00:58:18,080
Look at this place.

1120
00:58:18,115 --> 00:58:19,634
Look at these women.

1121
00:58:19,668 --> 00:58:25,709
This is the lodge where they
were tortured and killed.

1122
00:58:25,743 --> 00:58:27,055
I don't know
what is up with you

1123
00:58:27,089 --> 00:58:30,437
in this freaky, crazy
obsession that you have.

1124
00:58:30,472 --> 00:58:32,232
But you need to listen to me.

1125
00:58:32,267 --> 00:58:33,061
I'm listening.

1126
00:58:33,095 --> 00:58:34,925
No, you're not.

1127
00:58:34,959 --> 00:58:36,443
I've been trying--

1128
00:58:36,478 --> 00:58:38,031
I've been trying to
tell you something

1129
00:58:38,066 --> 00:58:40,033
for the last two weeks.

1130
00:58:40,068 --> 00:58:41,414
Tell me?

1131
00:58:41,448 --> 00:58:42,415
What could you possibly
tell me that I haven't

1132
00:58:42,449 --> 00:58:44,003
heard in the past two weeks?

1133
00:58:48,283 --> 00:58:49,008
I'm pregnant.

1134
00:59:01,227 --> 00:59:02,055
Breathe.

1135
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:02,884
It's going to be OK.

1136
00:59:02,918 --> 00:59:03,816
I want to go home.

1137
00:59:16,207 --> 00:59:19,348
Lou, Lou.

1138
00:59:19,383 --> 00:59:20,177
What's up?

1139
00:59:20,211 --> 00:59:21,247
Lou, come with us.

1140
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:24,595
Come with us downstairs.

1141
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:27,978
What you talking about,
come to you downstairs?

1142
00:59:28,012 --> 00:59:29,566
Rom needs our help, man.

1143
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,670
What do you
mean, he need help.

1144
00:59:30,705 --> 00:59:33,017
Rom needs-- Rom needs help.

1145
00:59:33,052 --> 00:59:34,329
Rom got hurt, Rom.

1146
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:35,054
Rom from hurt?

1147
00:59:35,088 --> 00:59:35,848
For what?

1148
00:59:35,882 --> 00:59:36,296
What you have?

1149
00:59:36,331 --> 00:59:37,608
How?

1150
00:59:37,643 --> 00:59:38,367
He was moving stuff
around in the basement.

1151
00:59:38,402 --> 00:59:39,506
He hurt himself.

1152
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:40,404
He needs our help
downstairs now.

1153
00:59:40,438 --> 00:59:42,337
Rom needs our help, man.

1154
00:59:45,202 --> 00:59:46,721
Oh, can't really be sick.

1155
00:59:52,347 --> 00:59:55,108
Right in.

1156
00:59:55,143 --> 00:59:56,489
Follow me.

1157
00:59:56,523 --> 00:59:58,940
It's all right, just follow me.

1158
00:59:58,974 --> 01:00:00,010
I got you .

1159
01:00:00,044 --> 01:00:01,321
Bro, I got you.

1160
01:00:01,356 --> 01:00:03,565
He needs you.

1161
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,498
How did he get down here?

1162
01:00:05,532 --> 01:00:06,223
He's here.

1163
01:00:06,257 --> 01:00:07,086
He needs you.

1164
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:10,261
Just come on, man.

1165
01:00:10,296 --> 01:00:10,986
Where you at, bro?

1166
01:00:11,021 --> 01:00:11,918
This way.

1167
01:00:11,953 --> 01:00:12,816
Rom!

1168
01:00:15,577 --> 01:00:16,233
Where he at?

1169
01:00:21,376 --> 01:00:22,066
Go.

1170
01:00:24,448 --> 01:00:25,656
What are you doing?

1171
01:00:25,691 --> 01:00:26,553
What y'all doing?

1172
01:00:30,212 --> 01:00:30,937
You're sick.

1173
01:00:39,049 --> 01:00:41,327
Ah!

1174
01:00:42,155 --> 01:00:44,295
Fuck off me, man.

1175
01:00:47,678 --> 01:00:48,921
This is what
we're doing, Russ?

1176
01:00:59,241 --> 01:01:01,692
Open the door.

1177
01:01:01,727 --> 01:01:03,245
Open this door, Russ!

1178
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,591
I'll be infected.

1179
01:01:04,626 --> 01:01:05,869
His own blood infected me, man.

1180
01:01:05,903 --> 01:01:07,318
I don't wanna fucking die.

1181
01:01:07,353 --> 01:01:08,112
Yo!

1182
01:01:08,147 --> 01:01:08,837
Just making--

1183
01:01:08,872 --> 01:01:09,562
Just get you upstairs.

1184
01:01:09,596 --> 01:01:10,528
Hold on.

1185
01:01:11,598 --> 01:01:12,392
Russ, it's OK.
I'm scared.

1186
01:01:12,427 --> 01:01:13,290
I don't wanna die.

1187
01:01:13,324 --> 01:01:13,911
Let's get you upstairs.

1188
01:01:13,946 --> 01:01:14,498
Please.

1189
01:01:14,532 --> 01:01:15,119
Goddamn, man.

1190
01:01:15,154 --> 01:01:16,258
Please.

1191
01:01:16,293 --> 01:01:17,674
I don't wanna fucking
die like this, man.

1192
01:01:19,537 --> 01:01:22,161
I know you ain't going
to leave me in here.

1193
01:01:23,127 --> 01:01:24,128
All right, sit down.

1194
01:01:24,163 --> 01:01:24,991
Ready?

1195
01:01:25,026 --> 01:01:26,199
We need to stop the bleeding.

1196
01:01:26,234 --> 01:01:27,407
And we need to clean him up.

1197
01:01:27,442 --> 01:01:28,512
I'll get something
to clean it maybe

1198
01:01:28,546 --> 01:01:31,515
and something to
put on the wound.

1199
01:01:31,549 --> 01:01:32,481
This side, this side.

1200
01:01:35,761 --> 01:01:36,658
Put the towel.

1201
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,624
Put the towel.

1202
01:01:37,659 --> 01:01:39,143
Russ, put pressure on it!

1203
01:01:39,765 --> 01:01:41,283
Aw, shit, man.

1204
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:43,976
What the hell is happening?

1205
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:44,562
Get out.

1206
01:01:44,597 --> 01:01:46,081
No, no, no, no.

1207
01:01:46,116 --> 01:01:47,427
Get out!

1208
01:01:47,462 --> 01:01:48,394
Babe.

1209
01:01:48,428 --> 01:01:51,190
What happened?

1210
01:01:51,224 --> 01:01:51,915
Babe, I'm sorry.

1211
01:01:54,745 --> 01:01:57,368
Keep pressure on it.

1212
01:01:57,403 --> 01:01:58,404
We just tried to put--

1213
01:01:58,438 --> 01:01:59,681
OK, here.

1214
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:00,682
-Lou into the basement
real quick so that

1215
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,166
he wouldn't get us all sick.

1216
01:02:02,201 --> 01:02:03,340
Basement?

1217
01:02:03,374 --> 01:02:04,513
We just didn't want him
to get everybody sick.

1218
01:02:04,548 --> 01:02:06,239
You understand that, right?

1219
01:02:06,274 --> 01:02:07,309
It just went down.

1220
01:02:07,344 --> 01:02:08,241
This is going to hurt.

1221
01:02:08,276 --> 01:02:09,104
This is going to hurt.

1222
01:02:12,245 --> 01:02:13,143
Ah.

1223
01:02:13,177 --> 01:02:14,144
What were you thinking?

1224
01:02:16,491 --> 01:02:17,803
Keep it covered.

1225
01:02:17,837 --> 01:02:20,667
No, you can't touch me.

1226
01:02:20,702 --> 01:02:22,117
Baby, I'm not going anywhere.

1227
01:02:22,152 --> 01:02:25,155
Baby, hold on, back
away from me right now.

1228
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:27,329
Open this!

1229
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:55,806
Open this door!

1230
01:02:58,878 --> 01:03:00,259
I'm not leaving you.

1231
01:03:00,293 --> 01:03:03,365
Babe, getting you sick
would be worse than dying.

1232
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,160
OK?

1233
01:03:05,195 --> 01:03:05,747
Baby, please.

1234
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,266
I can't go.

1235
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:10,165
Go lay down in
that bed right there.

1236
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,477
I don't wanna.

1237
01:03:11,511 --> 01:03:15,930
Tomorrow morning, as long
as I don't have no symptoms,

1238
01:03:15,964 --> 01:03:17,932
we'll get in the car,
one way or the other,

1239
01:03:17,966 --> 01:03:20,210
and we're going to get
the fuck out of here.

1240
01:03:20,244 --> 01:03:21,832
You hear me?

1241
01:03:21,867 --> 01:03:23,627
Do you trust me?

1242
01:03:23,661 --> 01:03:25,629
I love you.

1243
01:03:25,663 --> 01:03:26,941
I love you.

1244
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,700
Now go.

1245
01:03:32,049 --> 01:03:33,706
Meg!

1246
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,570
Wait.

1247
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:37,710
What happened?

1248
01:03:37,744 --> 01:03:39,125
I'm sorry, man.

1249
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,058
We just-- I don't know
what happened to me, bro.

1250
01:03:41,093 --> 01:03:41,818
Fuck.

1251
01:03:46,443 --> 01:03:47,927
You know I love Lou, right?

1252
01:03:53,277 --> 01:03:54,209
I'm sorry.

1253
01:04:03,184 --> 01:04:04,910
You know I would
never try to hurt him.

1254
01:04:04,944 --> 01:04:07,602
We just-- we just didn't want
him to get everybody sick.

1255
01:04:07,636 --> 01:04:10,363
Between this lodge
and the virus, man.

1256
01:04:10,398 --> 01:04:12,055
I'm going fucking crazy.

1257
01:04:12,089 --> 01:04:13,608
Bro, you don't understand, man.

1258
01:04:13,642 --> 01:04:16,783
Something got into me.

1259
01:04:16,818 --> 01:04:18,130
You believe me, right?

1260
01:04:18,164 --> 01:04:19,476
You know I would never
do that to him, right?

1261
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:24,481
I know.

1262
01:04:24,515 --> 01:04:25,585
I'm going to go downstairs.

1263
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,518
And I'm going to get Lou.

1264
01:04:27,553 --> 01:04:28,519
And I'll be back.

1265
01:04:28,554 --> 01:04:29,693
Tell Lou I'm sorry, man.

1266
01:04:29,727 --> 01:04:30,659
I'll be back.

1267
01:04:30,694 --> 01:04:33,352
Get Lou out of there, man.

1268
01:04:38,391 --> 01:04:39,876
Russ does not look good.

1269
01:04:45,571 --> 01:04:47,469
We've got to
get him some help.

1270
01:04:47,504 --> 01:04:49,023
There's got to be a
landline here somewhere.

1271
01:04:49,057 --> 01:04:50,231
I'm going to go
down to the front.

1272
01:04:50,265 --> 01:04:51,888
I'm going to get a
hold of the cops.

1273
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:54,131
We can't stay here like this.

1274
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:56,237
Get Lou out of that basement.

1275
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:56,927
OK.

1276
01:04:59,757 --> 01:05:00,413
OK.

1277
01:05:19,191 --> 01:05:20,088
How is Russ?

1278
01:05:20,123 --> 01:05:21,572
What the fuck
were you thinking?

1279
01:05:21,607 --> 01:05:22,849
What was I thinking?

1280
01:05:22,884 --> 01:05:25,059
I'm thinking, shit, Lou is sick.

1281
01:05:25,093 --> 01:05:27,061
We should put him where he
can't get other people sick.

1282
01:05:27,095 --> 01:05:28,476
That's what I'm thinking.

1283
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:29,960
No, Michael, you were only
thinking about yourself.

1284
01:05:29,995 --> 01:05:32,273
Now show me where you put him.

1285
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:32,998
Now!

1286
01:05:54,881 --> 01:05:56,055
What the fuck?

1287
01:06:00,818 --> 01:06:01,785
What?

1288
01:06:01,819 --> 01:06:03,269
Somebody in here?

1289
01:06:03,304 --> 01:06:06,307
They don't trust you.

1290
01:06:06,341 --> 01:06:07,032
Sick.

1291
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:12,485
You may as well come out now.

1292
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,900
You're sick.

1293
01:06:13,935 --> 01:06:15,454
What's that?

1294
01:06:15,488 --> 01:06:16,489
What the--

1295
01:06:19,665 --> 01:06:21,805
They said you're sick.

1296
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:22,806
They say you're sick.

1297
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,395
They don't trust you.

1298
01:06:25,429 --> 01:06:26,706
They don't trust you.

1299
01:06:26,741 --> 01:06:31,539
They don't trust you.

1300
01:06:31,573 --> 01:06:34,887
They say you're sick.

1301
01:06:36,406 --> 01:06:39,443
They don't believe you.

1302
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:01,672
Ugh.

1303
01:07:01,707 --> 01:07:03,674
Ah!

1304
01:07:03,709 --> 01:07:05,642
Ugh!

1305
01:07:05,676 --> 01:07:07,609
Ugh!

1306
01:07:07,644 --> 01:07:09,508
Ah!

1307
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:10,198
No!

1308
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:37,881
We are experiencing
technical difficulties

1309
01:07:37,915 --> 01:07:39,365
at this time.

1310
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,643
Please leave a message and
we will return your call--

1311
01:07:44,922 --> 01:07:46,683
What the fuck
were you thinking?

1312
01:07:46,717 --> 01:07:47,960
He's going to be pissed off.

1313
01:07:47,994 --> 01:07:49,444
Just make sure he
doesn't fucking hit me.

1314
01:08:01,801 --> 01:08:02,664
Why would he do that?

1315
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,226
What the hell is this?

1316
01:08:14,849 --> 01:08:16,161
What language is that?

1317
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:32,108
Oh, my god!

1318
01:08:37,872 --> 01:08:40,806
What is this?

1319
01:09:20,259 --> 01:09:22,848
No one's been here
for eight years?

1320
01:09:34,791 --> 01:09:35,930
She's scared.

1321
01:09:35,964 --> 01:09:38,553
We should have
been done already.

1322
01:09:38,588 --> 01:09:39,382
We all did it.

1323
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:45,664
Got to do it.

1324
01:09:45,698 --> 01:09:46,354
Do it.

1325
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:07,341
Sh.

1326
01:10:11,345 --> 01:10:14,106
Ah!

1327
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:17,903
She looks like she's dying.

1328
01:10:17,937 --> 01:10:18,869
You look like you're dying.

1329
01:10:19,905 --> 01:10:23,149
You look like you're dying.

1330
01:10:26,049 --> 01:10:26,705
Ah!

1331
01:10:42,893 --> 01:10:46,276
Why would he fucking do that?

1332
01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:48,968
Why would he fucking do that?

1333
01:10:49,003 --> 01:10:50,763
Why would he fucking do that!

1334
01:10:50,798 --> 01:10:51,799
Hey, Michael?

1335
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:52,938
What did he fucking do that?

1336
01:10:52,972 --> 01:10:53,973
It wasn't him.

1337
01:10:54,008 --> 01:10:55,078
Why would he fucking do that?

1338
01:10:55,112 --> 01:10:56,562
It wasn't him!

1339
01:10:56,597 --> 01:10:57,322
Michael, we--

1340
01:10:57,356 --> 01:10:58,530
This is my fucking fault.

1341
01:10:58,564 --> 01:11:00,221
We've all lost
something, Mike.

1342
01:11:10,818 --> 01:11:11,508
Rom?

1343
01:11:33,496 --> 01:11:34,082
Ah!

1344
01:11:34,876 --> 01:11:35,601
No, no, it's OK.

1345
01:11:35,636 --> 01:11:36,084
It's me.

1346
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:36,844
It's me.

1347
01:11:36,878 --> 01:11:37,741
You're OK.

1348
01:11:37,776 --> 01:11:38,708
You're OK.

1349
01:11:38,742 --> 01:11:40,054
You're OK.

1350
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:41,124
We got to go.

1351
01:11:41,158 --> 01:11:42,159
We've got to get
out of here, OK?

1352
01:11:42,194 --> 01:11:43,644
Come on.

1353
01:11:43,678 --> 01:11:44,955
We're going to get your
medicine and get out of here.

1354
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:45,680
Let's go.

1355
01:11:45,715 --> 01:11:46,578
We have to go.

1356
01:11:46,612 --> 01:11:47,475
We got to go.

1357
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:51,030
I'm going to get the others.

1358
01:12:01,938 --> 01:12:02,594
Ah!

1359
01:12:15,054 --> 01:12:17,954
Mike!

1360
01:12:17,988 --> 01:12:19,921
Mike!

1361
01:12:19,956 --> 01:12:22,268
Mike!

1362
01:12:26,307 --> 01:12:26,928
A warning sign.

1363
01:12:29,724 --> 01:12:30,276
Russ?

1364
01:12:38,699 --> 01:12:39,251
Russ?

1365
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:56,717
Yet I wonder--

1366
01:13:10,972 --> 01:13:11,732
Russ?

1367
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:47,561
Russ?

1368
01:13:57,709 --> 01:14:01,333
Mike, can you see her?

1369
01:14:03,508 --> 01:14:04,509
Oh, god.

1370
01:14:07,304 --> 01:14:08,478
She's there.

1371
01:14:11,274 --> 01:14:12,448
Oh, god!

1372
01:14:30,051 --> 01:14:30,707
Ah!

1373
01:14:33,917 --> 01:14:40,717
Oy, oy, no, no,
no, no, ah, ah, ah.

1374
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:51,348
Ah!

1375
01:14:51,383 --> 01:14:52,211
Help!

1376
01:14:52,246 --> 01:14:53,143
Get me out of here!

1377
01:14:53,178 --> 01:14:54,766
Ah!

1378
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,890
No, no.

1379
01:15:49,924 --> 01:15:52,064
Let me out!

1380
01:15:52,099 --> 01:15:53,825
Let me out!

1381
01:15:53,859 --> 01:15:55,896
Let me out!

1382
01:15:55,930 --> 01:15:57,863
Let me out!

1383
01:15:57,898 --> 01:15:58,830
Let me out!

1384
01:15:58,864 --> 01:15:59,934
Let me out!

1385
01:15:59,969 --> 01:16:01,039
Let me out!

1386
01:16:01,073 --> 01:16:01,833
Let me out!

1387
01:16:01,867 --> 01:16:03,179
Let me out!

1388
01:16:03,213 --> 01:16:04,180
Let me out!

1389
01:16:42,736 --> 01:16:53,885
What is going on?

1390
01:16:57,509 --> 01:16:58,165
Babe?

1391
01:17:00,823 --> 01:17:02,031
Serena?

1392
01:17:05,759 --> 01:17:06,760
Shut up!

1393
01:17:06,794 --> 01:17:07,933
Show me your hands.

1394
01:17:07,968 --> 01:17:09,970
I want to see your
hands right now.

1395
01:17:44,521 --> 01:17:46,144
You're OK.

1396
01:17:46,178 --> 01:17:47,317
Small breaths, come on.

1397
01:17:47,352 --> 01:17:48,422
Sit down.

1398
01:17:49,354 --> 01:17:50,010
Sit down.

1399
01:17:57,362 --> 01:17:59,605
It's not the virus.

1400
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,780
It's the lodge.

1401
01:18:01,815 --> 01:18:04,231
Las brujas del miedo.

1402
01:18:04,265 --> 01:18:05,404
What?

1403
01:18:05,439 --> 01:18:07,683
It means the
witches of fear.

1404
01:18:07,717 --> 01:18:13,827
And they're using
our fear to kill us.

1405
01:18:13,861 --> 01:18:15,794
We got to get out of here now.

1406
01:18:15,829 --> 01:18:16,968
I can't go out there.

1407
01:18:17,002 --> 01:18:17,865
I'm so scared.

1408
01:18:20,385 --> 01:18:21,524
We have to leave now.

1409
01:18:21,558 --> 01:18:22,939
Yeah, you're OK.

1410
01:18:22,974 --> 01:18:23,975
No, no, no, no, I've been
seeing things out there.

1411
01:18:24,009 --> 01:18:25,183
I don't want to go out there.

1412
01:18:25,217 --> 01:18:26,046
I don't want to do it.

1413
01:18:27,323 --> 01:18:28,531
OK.

1414
01:18:28,565 --> 01:18:29,359
Everyone's dead.

1415
01:18:29,394 --> 01:18:30,636
What?

1416
01:18:30,671 --> 01:18:32,466
Everyone-- Michael,
Meg, Russ, all dead.

1417
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,157
Everyone is dead.

1418
01:18:34,192 --> 01:18:35,227
Everyone is dead.

1419
01:18:35,262 --> 01:18:36,332
There's something--
there's something

1420
01:18:36,366 --> 01:18:37,436
going on in this lodge.

1421
01:18:37,471 --> 01:18:39,197
I see the pictures of us, right?

1422
01:18:39,231 --> 01:18:41,440
All, all the pictures are
blurred except for who's

1423
01:18:41,475 --> 01:18:42,372
in this room right now.

1424
01:18:42,407 --> 01:18:43,477
I see Meg's picture.

1425
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:44,409
Her face is blurred.

1426
01:18:44,443 --> 01:18:45,341
I go find Meg.

1427
01:18:45,375 --> 01:18:47,308
She's dead, OK?

1428
01:18:47,343 --> 01:18:49,586
I'm seeing the words.

1429
01:18:49,621 --> 01:18:52,106
I see, "no light Tamara."

1430
01:18:52,141 --> 01:18:55,109
At the bottom of the
painting, the numbers 4-1-9.

1431
01:18:55,144 --> 01:18:57,663
What does that mean?

1432
01:18:57,698 --> 01:19:01,495
Nolite, nolite, timere.

1433
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:03,221
Nolite timere, it's Latin.

1434
01:19:03,255 --> 01:19:04,360
Nolite timere.

1435
01:19:04,394 --> 01:19:07,570
It means, don't be afraid.

1436
01:19:07,604 --> 01:19:10,159
OK, yes, OK, so, so,
what is it for 4-1-9?

1437
01:19:10,193 --> 01:19:12,609
Is the 4-1-9 code
for do not be afraid?

1438
01:19:12,644 --> 01:19:14,266
What does the 4-1-9 mean?

1439
01:19:14,301 --> 01:19:15,336
It's a scripture.

1440
01:19:15,371 --> 01:19:16,096
What is-- a scripture of what?

1441
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:17,235
Scripture?

1442
01:19:17,269 --> 01:19:21,377
4-1-9, 4-1-9, 4-1-9,
4-1-9, I've seen that.

1443
01:19:21,411 --> 01:19:23,586
I've seen that number too.

1444
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:26,589
Last night, when I told you
that story about the witches

1445
01:19:26,623 --> 01:19:28,246
and the miners and the lodge--

1446
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:29,557
The witches?

1447
01:19:29,592 --> 01:19:30,731
-where they were
brought to be tortured.

1448
01:19:35,598 --> 01:19:37,462
That's here.

1449
01:19:37,496 --> 01:19:41,949
This is the lodge.

1450
01:19:41,984 --> 01:19:44,469
What the fuck are
you talking about, Rom?

1451
01:19:44,503 --> 01:19:45,815
There are places
all over the world

1452
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:47,713
that are portals for evil.

1453
01:19:47,748 --> 01:19:49,094
What are you talking about?

1454
01:19:49,129 --> 01:19:50,337
What does that have
anything to do with what's

1455
01:19:50,371 --> 01:19:51,303
happening right now?

1456
01:19:51,338 --> 01:19:52,995
I'm trying to tell you.

1457
01:19:53,029 --> 01:19:54,824
Each one of these
portals has what

1458
01:19:54,859 --> 01:19:56,481
is called a
gatekeeper whose only

1459
01:19:56,515 --> 01:20:02,487
purpose is to feed the
portal souls, souls like us.

1460
01:20:02,521 --> 01:20:05,870
And they consume our souls to
give themselves eternal life

1461
01:20:05,904 --> 01:20:07,768
and to keep the portal alive.

1462
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,908
The witches I told
you about last night?

1463
01:20:09,943 --> 01:20:12,704
They live in these portals.

1464
01:20:12,738 --> 01:20:14,119
Las brujas del miedo.

1465
01:20:14,154 --> 01:20:15,465
What?

1466
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:19,124
It means the witches of fear.

1467
01:20:19,159 --> 01:20:22,196
You've lost your fucking mind.

1468
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,826
The woman that was downstairs
that checked us in,

1469
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:33,380
she's like a gatekeeper?

1470
01:20:33,414 --> 01:20:34,726
Yes.

1471
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,210
Did you know this before
you brought us here?

1472
01:20:36,245 --> 01:20:37,798
I thought it was
just a story, Serena.

1473
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:38,730
You thought it was just--

1474
01:20:38,764 --> 01:20:40,766
I didn't know.

1475
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:42,561
I was just trying
to research my book.

1476
01:20:42,596 --> 01:20:43,839
Why would you bring us here?

1477
01:20:43,873 --> 01:20:45,392
I didn't know.

1478
01:20:45,426 --> 01:20:47,704
But what I do know is that
they are feeding on our fear.

1479
01:20:47,739 --> 01:20:49,258
And everything
that we are seeing,

1480
01:20:49,292 --> 01:20:54,919
everything that we are feeling,
I don't believe it's real.

1481
01:20:54,953 --> 01:20:58,370
So everything we're
seeing isn't real?

1482
01:20:58,405 --> 01:20:59,785
It is if you believe it.

1483
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:02,685
And if you believe
it, it will kill you.

1484
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:03,720
Babe, what are you doing?

1485
01:21:03,755 --> 01:21:04,687
We have to get out of here now.

1486
01:21:04,721 --> 01:21:05,653
Just give me a minute, OK?

1487
01:21:05,688 --> 01:21:06,413
Give me a second.

1488
01:21:06,447 --> 01:21:09,243
This is on you.

1489
01:21:09,278 --> 01:21:11,694
Our friends are dead
because of you, Rom.

1490
01:21:11,728 --> 01:21:12,764
I'm sorry.

1491
01:21:12,798 --> 01:21:14,766
Isaiah chapter 41 verse 9.

1492
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,733
I have taken you to
the ends of the Earth.

1493
01:21:16,768 --> 01:21:21,635
From the farthest
corners, I called you

1494
01:21:21,669 --> 01:21:22,843
and not rejected you.

1495
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,914
So fear not, for I am with you.

1496
01:21:24,949 --> 01:21:27,468
But I have chosen me
and not cast thee away.

1497
01:21:27,503 --> 01:21:28,538
You guys--

1498
01:21:28,573 --> 01:21:29,539
We've got to get out of here.

1499
01:21:29,574 --> 01:21:30,299
Come on.

1500
01:21:35,511 --> 01:21:36,408
Ah!

1501
01:21:57,671 --> 01:21:58,603
I think it's over.

1502
01:21:59,535 --> 01:22:00,191
Ah!

1503
01:22:04,057 --> 01:22:05,541
Benny, it's OK.

1504
01:22:05,575 --> 01:22:08,475
It's not real.

1505
01:22:08,509 --> 01:22:09,303
What's that?

1506
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:13,376
It's real.

1507
01:22:13,411 --> 01:22:15,344
It's not real.

1508
01:22:15,378 --> 01:22:17,001
We're manifesting fear.

1509
01:22:17,035 --> 01:22:18,795
We have to take a
chance and go outside.

1510
01:22:18,830 --> 01:22:20,970
The disease
is way more severe than anyone

1511
01:22:21,005 --> 01:22:22,144
could have actually imagined.

1512
01:22:22,178 --> 01:22:22,627
Oh my god.

1513
01:22:22,661 --> 01:22:23,662
Let's go.

1514
01:22:23,697 --> 01:22:24,491
I cried out.

1515
01:22:24,525 --> 01:22:25,906
And no one heard me.

1516
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,321
And I was trying to get help.

1517
01:23:04,565 --> 01:23:05,497
It's OK.

1518
01:23:05,532 --> 01:23:07,499
You're OK.

1519
01:23:07,534 --> 01:23:08,535
You're OK.

1520
01:23:13,574 --> 01:23:14,334
We've got to go.

1521
01:23:26,449 --> 01:23:28,348
We got to take
our chances outside.

1522
01:23:28,382 --> 01:23:29,038
Come on.

1523
01:23:29,073 --> 01:23:29,797
We just got to run.

1524
01:23:29,832 --> 01:23:31,592
Sh.

1525
01:23:31,627 --> 01:23:33,353
Put this on.

1526
01:23:33,387 --> 01:23:35,251
Don't breathe until
we get to the car.

1527
01:23:37,253 --> 01:23:38,599
Ah!

1528
01:23:42,465 --> 01:23:43,156
Ah!

1529
01:23:51,819 --> 01:23:54,408
We have to go get her.

1530
01:23:54,443 --> 01:23:55,444
Hell no.

1531
01:24:03,797 --> 01:24:04,625
You're crazy.

1532
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:06,420
Don't go down there.

1533
01:24:06,455 --> 01:24:06,869
What y'all doing?

1534
01:24:06,903 --> 01:24:07,594
Stop!

1535
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:23,679
Serena?

1536
01:24:29,409 --> 01:24:30,099
Serena?

1537
01:25:01,372 --> 01:25:02,062
Serena.

1538
01:25:05,652 --> 01:25:06,687
What's up, man?

1539
01:25:06,722 --> 01:25:08,068
Step out of the car.

1540
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,552
You know I ain't do nothing.

1541
01:25:09,587 --> 01:25:11,209
You ain't got to shine
the light in my face.

1542
01:25:11,244 --> 01:25:12,486
I didn't do nothing.

1543
01:25:12,521 --> 01:25:14,178
I said, get
out of the car now.

1544
01:25:14,212 --> 01:25:15,213
What ya'll doing, man?

1545
01:25:15,248 --> 01:25:16,145
I said I ain't doing nothing.

1546
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,112
I'm just driving home.

1547
01:25:17,146 --> 01:25:19,804
Man, I ain't do nothing.

1548
01:25:19,838 --> 01:25:20,494
Serena.

1549
01:25:26,949 --> 01:25:27,639
Oh, god.

1550
01:25:32,679 --> 01:25:33,335
Ah!

1551
01:25:37,615 --> 01:25:38,857
Serena?

1552
01:25:38,892 --> 01:25:40,135
No, no.

1553
01:25:43,759 --> 01:25:46,244
Serena, what's happening?

1554
01:25:51,732 --> 01:25:53,078
We've got to go!

1555
01:25:53,113 --> 01:25:58,670
Serena, Serena, Serena,
whatever you're seeing,

1556
01:25:58,705 --> 01:26:00,016
it's inside your head.

1557
01:26:04,849 --> 01:26:05,505
Help!

1558
01:26:10,234 --> 01:26:11,476
It's not real.

1559
01:26:11,511 --> 01:26:12,581
Serena!

1560
01:26:12,615 --> 01:26:13,513
Don't believe it.

1561
01:26:17,862 --> 01:26:18,794
Help!

1562
01:26:24,662 --> 01:26:27,596
Help!

1563
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:29,701
Serena, we're here.

1564
01:26:29,736 --> 01:26:30,599
Come to us.

1565
01:26:36,846 --> 01:26:38,193
We're here.

1566
01:26:47,029 --> 01:26:50,584
Ah!

1567
01:26:50,619 --> 01:26:51,309
Ah!

1568
01:26:51,344 --> 01:26:52,655
Ah!

1569
01:26:57,902 --> 01:26:58,558
Benny!

1570
01:26:58,592 --> 01:26:59,248
Benny!

1571
01:27:06,945 --> 01:27:08,913
What-- what?

1572
01:27:12,537 --> 01:27:14,643
Oh, my god.

1573
01:27:14,677 --> 01:27:16,127
Benny.

1574
01:27:16,161 --> 01:27:18,543
Baby, keep going.

1575
01:27:18,578 --> 01:27:19,958
We've got to go.

1576
01:27:19,993 --> 01:27:21,581
I told you I
didn't do nothing!

1577
01:27:26,068 --> 01:27:28,484
I'm sorry.

1578
01:27:28,519 --> 01:27:30,797
I'm s--

1579
01:27:30,831 --> 01:27:32,177
We need to get out.

1580
01:27:32,212 --> 01:27:34,456
Let's go.

1581
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:35,802
I'm sorry.

1582
01:27:35,836 --> 01:27:38,149
Benny, what did you do?

1583
01:27:38,183 --> 01:27:41,048
I had to.

1584
01:27:51,887 --> 01:27:53,233
Don't do it, Benny.

1585
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:54,648
Benny, no!

1586
01:27:56,029 --> 01:27:57,962
Ah!

1587
01:27:57,996 --> 01:27:59,515
Ah!

1588
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:01,517
Ah!

1589
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:07,661
I can't feel my legs.

1590
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:12,666
We have to go.

1591
01:28:12,701 --> 01:28:13,840
We have to go.

1592
01:28:28,095 --> 01:28:29,856
Bianca, I'm sorry.

1593
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:34,481
You know you can't
beat it physically.

1594
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:38,727
You have to beat it mentally.

1595
01:28:43,939 --> 01:28:45,906
You can beat this thing.

1596
01:28:45,941 --> 01:28:47,874
Don't lose your faith.

1597
01:28:47,908 --> 01:28:49,047
I love you.

1598
01:28:49,082 --> 01:28:50,635
Now go.

1599
01:29:01,612 --> 01:29:03,959
Ah!

1600
01:29:51,282 --> 01:29:53,940
Bianca, it's not real.

1601
01:30:08,679 --> 01:30:09,127
Oh!

1602
01:30:09,162 --> 01:30:10,163
Oh!

1603
01:30:19,103 --> 01:30:22,071
Ah!

1604
01:31:10,913 --> 01:31:12,984
Come on, you can do it.

1605
01:31:13,019 --> 01:31:15,711
Use your faith.

1606
01:31:17,437 --> 01:31:19,543
It's taken you to
the ends of the Earth

1607
01:31:19,577 --> 01:31:23,236
from the farthest corners
and I've called you.

1608
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:25,652
I will strengthen
you and help you.

1609
01:31:25,687 --> 01:31:28,137
I called you and
not rejected you.

1610
01:31:28,172 --> 01:31:31,727
So fear not, for I am with you.

1611
01:31:35,144 --> 01:31:36,111
Do not be dismayed.

1612
01:31:40,564 --> 01:31:41,875
For I am your god!

1613
01:31:43,325 --> 01:31:46,570
And hold,
my richest hand.

1614
01:31:46,604 --> 01:31:47,812
Praying with you.

1615
01:31:47,847 --> 01:31:50,056
Do not be deceived,
for am I you god.

1616
01:31:55,164 --> 01:32:05,658
For I am with you.

1617
01:33:47,483 --> 01:33:49,554
Oh, that shit is on.

1618
01:33:49,589 --> 01:33:53,041
Let me drop some
shit like this here.

1619
01:33:53,075 --> 01:33:54,283
At night, I can't sleep.

1620
01:33:54,318 --> 01:33:55,837
I toss and turn.

1621
01:33:55,871 --> 01:33:58,529
Candlesticks in the dark,
visions of bodies being burned.

1622
01:33:58,563 --> 01:34:00,393
Four walls just
staring at a nigga.

1623
01:34:00,427 --> 01:34:03,707
I'm paranoid sleeping with
my finger on the trigger.

1624
01:34:03,741 --> 01:34:05,122
On the scene there,

1625
01:34:05,156 --> 01:34:08,746
another terrible story
today as WRLA's Brian Mann

1626
01:34:08,781 --> 01:34:11,300
brings us the
latest on who died.

1627
01:34:11,335 --> 01:34:13,095
Polive have spent hours--

1628
01:34:13,130 --> 01:34:18,169
Police have spent hours
of Sunday investigating--

1629
01:34:23,554 --> 01:34:24,520
Let me out!

1630
01:34:24,555 --> 01:34:25,349
Let me out!

1631
01:34:25,383 --> 01:34:28,939
Let me out!

1632
01:34:48,544 --> 01:34:49,614
Fear.

1633
01:34:49,649 --> 01:34:50,650
Fear exists in the mind.

1634
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:51,927
Everybody afraid of something.

1635
01:34:51,962 --> 01:34:53,239
Everybody got religions
of their own kind.

1636
01:34:53,273 --> 01:34:54,723
Everybody prayed for something.

1637
01:34:54,758 --> 01:34:56,207
And I got to hold it down
for me and mine out here.

1638
01:34:56,242 --> 01:34:57,657
I can't play with nothing
but stay with your scary ass

1639
01:34:57,692 --> 01:34:59,107
in the house.
Think better thoughts.

1640
01:34:59,141 --> 01:35:00,522
If you need to save your
buddies, just whip it, man.

1641
01:35:00,556 --> 01:35:01,488
Somebody pinch me.

1642
01:35:01,523 --> 01:35:02,697
I had a dream.

1643
01:35:02,731 --> 01:35:03,939
I had a dream.
Everything played out.

1644
01:35:03,974 --> 01:35:04,768
And my real life was
something I seen.

1645
01:35:04,802 --> 01:35:06,183
Something I seen.

1646
01:35:06,217 --> 01:35:07,218
I'm just trying to get
all that out my thoughts,

1647
01:35:07,253 --> 01:35:08,012
but it won't leave.

1648
01:35:08,047 --> 01:35:09,220
Somebody scream.

1649
01:35:09,255 --> 01:35:10,256
I'm the only one right
now that's in this house,

1650
01:35:10,290 --> 01:35:11,119
but I hear screams.

1651
01:35:11,153 --> 01:35:11,947
This is real life.

1652
01:35:11,982 --> 01:35:13,155
No, this ain't for thing for TV.

1653
01:35:13,190 --> 01:35:14,501
It can't be televised.

1654
01:35:14,536 --> 01:35:15,571
Every day a gamble.

1655
01:35:15,606 --> 01:35:17,125
You get up and roll the dice.

1656
01:35:17,159 --> 01:35:19,748
You never know what's waiting
for you on the other side,

1657
01:35:19,783 --> 01:35:21,370
on the other side.

1658
01:35:21,405 --> 01:35:23,062
I can see it in their eyes that
I'm something that they fear.

1659
01:35:23,096 --> 01:35:25,650
Homie caught his first body,
but he did it out of fear.

1660
01:35:25,685 --> 01:35:27,583
Survival of the fittest
don't mistake quietness.

1661
01:35:27,618 --> 01:35:28,826
Fear.

1662
01:35:28,861 --> 01:35:29,931
Claim you ready for
the smoke with no,

1663
01:35:29,965 --> 01:35:33,279
all I see is-- fear, fear.

1664
01:35:33,313 --> 01:35:34,798
You know I'm traumatized.

1665
01:35:34,832 --> 01:35:36,903
When I hear the front door,
you can see it in my eyes.

1666
01:35:36,938 --> 01:35:38,456
You ever felt like that close.

1667
01:35:38,491 --> 01:35:41,390
The only thing I know, is
you shouldn't trust the soul.

1668
01:35:41,425 --> 01:35:42,944
Probably the saints say.

1669
01:35:42,978 --> 01:35:45,256
When I still living with my
mama, I left the crib at 17.

1670
01:35:45,291 --> 01:35:48,156
If I don't say my prayer at
night, I have a bad dream.

1671
01:35:48,190 --> 01:35:50,572
Penitentiary chances, hope
I don't go to the bing.

1672
01:35:50,606 --> 01:35:53,333
Riding around in the traffic
with a thumper when I sling.

1673
01:35:53,368 --> 01:35:56,095
I'm hoping somebody hear me
so it don't fall on deaf ears.

1674
01:35:56,129 --> 01:35:58,683
I'm out here with the snakes
and the snake my biggest fear.

1675
01:35:58,718 --> 01:35:59,995
I ain't trying to speak
it into existence.

1676
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:01,479
Hope I make myself clear.

1677
01:36:01,514 --> 01:36:03,240
But please provide me with
some assistance sometime.

1678
01:36:03,274 --> 01:36:04,448
I think death is near.

1679
01:36:04,482 --> 01:36:05,414
This is real life.

1680
01:36:05,449 --> 01:36:06,933
No, this ain't for TV.

1681
01:36:06,968 --> 01:36:08,452
It can't be televised.

1682
01:36:08,486 --> 01:36:09,522
Every day a gamble.

1683
01:36:09,556 --> 01:36:11,041
You get up and roll the dice.

1684
01:36:11,075 --> 01:36:13,802
You never know it's waiting
for you on the other side.

1685
01:36:13,837 --> 01:36:15,770
On the other side.

1686
01:36:15,804 --> 01:36:16,667
This is real life.

1687
01:36:16,701 --> 01:36:17,737
No, this ain't for TV.

1688
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:19,290
It can't be televised.

1689
01:36:19,325 --> 01:36:20,360
Every day a gamble.

1690
01:36:20,395 --> 01:36:21,914
You get up and roll the dice.

1691
01:36:21,948 --> 01:36:24,640
You never know what's waiting
for you on the other side,

1692
01:36:24,675 --> 01:36:25,814
on the other side.

1693
01:36:26,815 --> 01:36:28,748
Zip code, no shoes,
marble floors.

1694
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:30,025
Bitch tip toe.

1695
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:32,096
Floatsies with your
bitch at the Crypto.

1696
01:36:32,131 --> 01:36:32,821
Yeah.

1697
01:36:32,856 --> 01:36:34,098
Bunny rabbit did grow.

1698
01:36:34,133 --> 01:36:36,031
Who's that peeping in my window?

1699
01:36:36,066 --> 01:36:37,446
Got me--

1700
01:36:37,481 --> 01:36:40,725
Tip toe, sing.

1701
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:42,210
Let you slide.

1702
01:36:42,244 --> 01:36:43,659
Finna wrap them up in plastic,
just another homicide.

1703
01:36:43,694 --> 01:36:45,627
And I drop them off
like axes, but you

1704
01:36:45,661 --> 01:36:46,662
ain't no friend of mine.

1705
01:36:46,697 --> 01:36:47,698
And I can't trust them, nothing.

1706
01:36:47,732 --> 01:36:48,768
This is real life.

1707
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:50,287
No, this ain't for TV.

1708
01:36:50,321 --> 01:36:51,564
It can't be televised.

1709
01:36:51,598 --> 01:36:52,668
Every day a gamble.

1710
01:36:52,703 --> 01:36:54,222
You get up and roll the dice.

1711
01:36:54,256 --> 01:36:56,603
You never know what's waiting
for you on the other side.

1712
01:36:56,638 --> 01:36:58,226
On the other side.

1713
01:36:58,260 --> 01:36:59,917
I can see it in their eyes that
I'm something that they fear.

1714
01:36:59,952 --> 01:37:02,747
Homie caught his first body,
but he did it out fear.

1715
01:37:02,782 --> 01:37:04,715
Survival of the fittest,
don't mistake quietness.

1716
01:37:04,749 --> 01:37:06,165
Fear.

1717
01:37:06,199 --> 01:37:07,649
Claim you ready for this
smoke, but no, but all I see

1718
01:37:07,683 --> 01:37:08,926
is fear, fear.

1719
01:37:08,961 --> 01:37:10,169
One-- take a minute
to kick it with me.

1720
01:37:10,203 --> 01:37:11,653
Let's talk about what
you're afraid of.

1721
01:37:11,687 --> 01:37:12,654
You're aware that
fear is something

1722
01:37:12,688 --> 01:37:13,482
that only exist in your mind.

1723
01:37:13,517 --> 01:37:14,518
So what you made of?

1724
01:37:14,552 --> 01:37:15,657
They're afraid of my growth.

1725
01:37:15,691 --> 01:37:16,969
Majority shit you
see is made up.

1726
01:37:17,003 --> 01:37:18,418
I put all my faith in
my god and make sure

1727
01:37:18,453 --> 01:37:19,695
we talk every time I wake up.

1728
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:21,456
Like, listen, Lord,
I ain't no angel,

1729
01:37:21,490 --> 01:37:22,491
but, nigga, with feelings, Lord.

1730
01:37:22,526 --> 01:37:23,803
A good nigga with a good heart.

1731
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:25,425
Did everybody trying
to turn it to the Lord.

1732
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:27,358
And I know that me having faith
is the first step I gotta take.

1733
01:37:27,393 --> 01:37:28,773
The mean hitter, Lord.

1734
01:37:28,808 --> 01:37:29,740
So forgive me, Lord as I
put on these black gloves

1735
01:37:29,774 --> 01:37:30,637
and kill these niggas, Lord.

1736
01:37:30,672 --> 01:37:31,638
Fear.
